MongoDB transactions are an important feature for applications that require data integrity and consistency. However, when working with NestJS and Mongoose, it can be difficult to get transactions working correctly. This article will discuss some of the common mistakes that developers make when trying to get transactions working with NestJS and Mongoose, as well as provide some examples of code to help illustrate the correct way to use transactions.

## What is a Transaction?

A transaction is a set of operations that must all be applied together in order to guarantee the integrity of the data. In the context of MongoDB, a transaction is a set of operations that must all be applied in order to guarantee the data is consistent and correct. Transactions are important for applications that require data consistency and integrity, such as financial applications or applications where data is shared between multiple users.

## Common Mistakes When Working with Transactions

When working with transactions in MongoDB, there are a few common mistakes that developers make. The first mistake is not using the correct transaction options. MongoDB transactions use a set of options to specify the type of transaction and the level of isolation. It is important to understand these options and use the correct ones for the application.

The second mistake is not using the correct Mongoose functions. Mongoose provides a set of functions that are specifically designed for use in transactions. It is important to understand these functions and use them correctly.

The third mistake is not using the correct Mongoose models. Mongoose models provide a convenient way to access data in MongoDB. However, when using transactions, it is important to make sure that the correct models are used.

The fourth mistake is not using the correct Mongoose query functions. Mongoose provides a set of query functions that are designed for use in transactions. It is important to understand these functions and use them correctly.

## Using Transactions with NestJS and Mongoose

NestJS is a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. It provides a powerful set of tools for building web applications, including the ability to use MongoDB transactions. When using transactions with NestJS, it is important to make sure that the correct Mongoose functions and models are used.

To use transactions with NestJS and Mongoose, the first step is to create a Mongoose model. This model will be used to access the data in the database. For example, the following code creates a Mongoose model for a user:

```javascript
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

Once the model is created, the next step is to create a Mongoose transaction. This is done by calling the `transaction()` function on the Mongoose model. For example, the following code creates a Mongoose transaction for a user:

```javascript
const session = await mongoose.startSession();
session.startTransaction();

const opts = { session };

const user = await User.create({
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  password: 'password',
}, opts);

await session.commitTransaction();
session.endSession();
```

The `opts` object is used to pass the session to the Mongoose model. This is important for transactions, as it ensures that all operations in the transaction are applied to the same session.

Once the transaction is created, the next step is to perform the operations in the transaction. This is done by using the Mongoose query functions. For example, the following code creates a new user in the database using the `create()` query function:

```javascript
const user = await User.create({
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  password: 'password',
}, opts);
```

The `opts` object is again used to pass the session to the Mongoose model. This ensures that the operation is applied to the same session as the transaction.

Once the operations are performed, the final step is to commit the transaction. This is done by calling the `commitTransaction()` function on the session. For example, the following code commits the transaction:

```javascript
await session.commitTransaction();
session.endSession();
```

## Conclusion

When working with transactions in NestJS and Mongoose, it is important to make sure that the correct Mongoose functions and models are used. It is also important to understand the transaction options and use the correct ones for the application. Finally, it is important to make sure that all operations in the transaction are applied to the same session. By understanding these concepts and using the correct Mongoose functions, it is possible to use transactions with NestJS and Mongoose.
When trying to set up MongoDB transactions with NestJS and Mongoose, you may encounter some errors. This post will provide a step-by-step guide on how to properly set up a MongoDB transaction with NestJS/Mongoose.

## What is a MongoDB Transaction?
A MongoDB transaction is a set of operations that are executed as a single unit. All operations are either performed or none of them are. Transactions provide atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties, which makes them ideal for certain types of data operations such as financial transactions.

## Setting Up a MongoDB Transaction with NestJS/Mongoose
Before we can set up a MongoDB transaction with NestJS/Mongoose, we need to have a basic understanding of how NestJS and Mongoose work together. NestJS is a server-side JavaScript framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications. Mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, which allows us to easily map our data models to MongoDB documents.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
The first step is to install the necessary dependencies. We'll need to install the `@nestjs/mongoose` package, which provides a set of features for working with Mongoose in NestJS. We'll also need to install the `mongoose-transactions` package, which provides a set of features for working with MongoDB transactions.

```bash
npm install @nestjs/mongoose mongoose-transactions
```

### Step 2: Create a Mongoose Model
Once we have the dependencies installed, we can create a Mongoose model for our data. This model will define the structure of our data and will be used to map our data to documents in MongoDB.

```typescript
import { Schema } from 'mongoose';

const UserSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  }
});

export default UserSchema;
```

### Step 3: Create a Mongoose Service
Once we have our model created, we can create a Mongoose service that will handle our database operations. This service will be responsible for creating, updating, and deleting documents in our MongoDB database.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectModel } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Model } from 'mongoose';
import UserSchema from './user.schema';

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(@InjectModel('User', UserSchema) private readonly userModel: Model<UserSchema>) {}

  async create(user: UserSchema): Promise<UserSchema> {
    const createdUser = new this.userModel(user);
    return await createdUser.save();
  }

  async findAll(): Promise<UserSchema[]> {
    return await this.userModel.find().exec();
  }

  async findOne(id: string): Promise<UserSchema> {
    return await this.userModel.findById(id).exec();
  }

  async update(id: string, user: UserSchema): Promise<UserSchema> {
    return await this.userModel.findByIdAndUpdate(id, user, { new: true });
  }

  async delete(id: string): Promise<UserSchema> {
    return await this.userModel.findByIdAndDelete(id);
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Create a Mongoose Transaction Service
Now that we have our Mongoose service set up, we can create a Mongoose transaction service that will handle our MongoDB transactions. This service will be responsible for creating, committing, and rolling back transactions.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectModel } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Model } from 'mongoose';
import UserSchema from './user.schema';
import Transaction from 'mongoose-transactions';

@Injectable()
export class TransactionService {
  constructor(@InjectModel('User', UserSchema) private readonly userModel: Model<UserSchema>) {}

  async createTransaction(): Promise<Transaction> {
    return new Transaction(this.userModel.db);
  }

  async commitTransaction(transaction: Transaction): Promise<void> {
    await transaction.commit();
  }

  async rollbackTransaction(transaction: Transaction): Promise<void> {
    await transaction.rollback();
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Use the Transaction Service
Finally, we can use our transaction service to execute our MongoDB transactions. We can use the `createTransaction()` method to create a new transaction, the `commitTransaction()` method to commit the transaction, and the `rollbackTransaction()` method to rollback the transaction if something goes wrong.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectModel } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Model } from 'mongoose';
import UserSchema from './user.schema';
import TransactionService from './transaction.service';

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(
    @InjectModel('User', UserSchema) private readonly userModel: Model<UserSchema>,
    private readonly transactionService: TransactionService
  ) {}

  async create(user: UserSchema): Promise<UserSchema> {
    const transaction = await this.transactionService.createTransaction();
    const createdUser = new this.userModel(user);

    try {
      await transaction.insert('User', createdUser);
      await this.transactionService.commitTransaction(transaction);
      return createdUser;
    } catch (error) {
      await this.transactionService.rollbackTransaction(transaction);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  async findAll(): Promise<UserSchema[]> {
    return await this.userModel.find().exec();
  }

  async findOne(id: string): Promise<UserSchema> {
    return await this.userModel.findById(id).exec();
  }

  async update(id: string, user: UserSchema): Promise<UserSchema> {
    const transaction = await this.transactionService.createTransaction();

    try {
      const updatedUser = await this.userModel.findByIdAndUpdate(id, user, { new: true });
      await transaction.update('User', id, user);
      await this.transactionService.commitTransaction(transaction);
      return updatedUser;
    } catch (error) {
      await this.transactionService.rollbackTransaction(transaction);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  async delete(id: string): Promise<UserSchema> {
    const transaction = await this.transactionService.createTransaction();

    try {
      const deletedUser = await this.userModel.findByIdAndDelete(id);
      await transaction.remove('User', id);
      await this.transactionService.commitTransaction(transaction);
      return deletedUser;
    } catch (error) {
      await this.transactionService.rollbackTransaction(transaction);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
