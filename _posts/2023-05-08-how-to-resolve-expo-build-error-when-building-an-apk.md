When building an APK from an Expo project, it's not uncommon to encounter errors. These errors can be difficult to diagnose, as they are often caused by a variety of different issues. In this article, we'll look at some of the most common Expo build errors and how to resolve them.

## Common Mistakes

The most common mistake when building an APK from an Expo project is forgetting to update the `app.json` file. This file contains important information about the project, such as the version number and the package name. If this file is not updated, the build will fail.

Another common mistake is forgetting to run the `expo build:android` command before attempting to build the APK. Without running this command, the build will not be able to access the necessary files and will fail.

Finally, forgetting to run the `expo publish` command before attempting to build the APK can also cause errors. This command is used to publish the project to the Expo servers, which are needed to build the APK.

## Error Messages

When building an APK from an Expo project, there are a variety of error messages that can be encountered. Here are some of the most common messages, along with explanations of what they mean and how to fix them.

### `Failed to get manifest`

This error occurs when the `app.json` file is not updated. To fix this, open the `app.json` file and update the version number and package name.

### `Build failed with an unexpected error`

This error occurs when the `expo build:android` command is not run before attempting to build the APK. To fix this, run the `expo build:android` command in the terminal.

### `No published releases found`

This error occurs when the `expo publish` command is not run before attempting to build the APK. To fix this, run the `expo publish` command in the terminal.

## Conclusion

Building an APK from an Expo project can be a difficult task, as there are a variety of errors that can be encountered. To ensure that the build process is successful, it's important to remember to update the `app.json` file, run the `expo build:android` command, and run the `expo publish` command before attempting to build the APK. By following these steps, the build process should be successful and the APK should be created without any errors.

When it comes to building an APK, there are a lot of potential errors that can arise. One of the most common errors that developers face is the Expo Build Error. This error can be caused by a variety of factors and can be difficult to resolve. Fortunately, this guide will provide a step-by-step solution to help you resolve the error quickly and easily. 

### Step 1: Check Your Expo Version

The first step to resolving the Expo Build Error is to make sure that you are running the latest version of Expo. To do this, open the terminal and type the following command: 

```
expo -v
```

This will check your current version of Expo and tell you if there is a newer version available. If there is, make sure to update to the latest version before proceeding. 

### Step 2: Check Your Bundle Identifier

The next step is to make sure that your bundle identifier is correct. Your bundle identifier is a unique string that identifies your application and is used to identify it in the app store. To check your bundle identifier, open your project in Xcode and navigate to the “General” tab. There, you should see your bundle identifier listed. Make sure that it is correct and matches the one listed in your Expo project. 

### Step 3: Check Your App Icon

The next step is to make sure that your app icon is correct. Your app icon is the icon that is displayed on the home screen of the device when the app is installed. To check your app icon, open your project in Xcode and navigate to the “App Icons & Launch Images” tab. There, you should see a list of icons and their associated sizes. Make sure that all of the icons are correct and that the sizes match the ones listed in your Expo project. 

### Step 4: Check Your Build Configuration

The final step is to make sure that your build configuration is correct. To do this, open your project in Xcode and navigate to the “Build Settings” tab. There, you should see a list of build configurations. Make sure that they are all correct and that they match the ones listed in your Expo project. 

### Conclusion 

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you should be able to quickly and easily resolve the Expo Build Error. Remember to always check your Expo version, bundle identifier, app icon, and build configuration before attempting to build an APK. Doing so will ensure that your application is properly configured and that any potential errors can be resolved quickly and easily.
