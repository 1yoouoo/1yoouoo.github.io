When working with JavaScript and TypeScript, it is common to encounter errors related to the language's syntax. One such error is the `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` when attempting to import one's own class. This error can be confusing to debug, as the code may appear to be correct. In this article, we will explore the causes of this error and how to fix it.

## What is the `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` Error?

The `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` error is thrown when attempting to import one's own class. This error occurs due to the way JavaScript and TypeScript handle imports. In order to understand why this error occurs, we must first understand how imports work in these languages.

In JavaScript and TypeScript, imports are used to access the code or data from another file. When importing a class, the code is imported from the file that contains the class definition. However, if the class is imported from a file that is not the same as the file containing the class definition, an error is thrown. This is because the language cannot determine which file should be imported. 

## Common Mistakes

When encountering the `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` error, there are a few common mistakes that can lead to it. The most common mistake is attempting to import a class from a file that is not the same as the file containing the class definition. This can happen when attempting to import a class from a file that is imported from another file. 

Another common mistake is attempting to import a class from a file that does not exist. This can occur when the file containing the class definition is not imported, or when the file is imported but does not contain the class definition.

## Example

To better understand the `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` error, let's look at an example. Consider the following code, which attempts to import a class from a file that is imported from another file:

```javascript
// FileA.js
import FileB from './FileB';

class MyClass {
  // ...
}

export default MyClass;

// FileB.js
import MyClass from './FileA';

// ...
```

In this example, we are attempting to import the `MyClass` class from `FileA.js` in `FileB.js`. However, this will throw the `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` error, as the language cannot determine which file should be imported.

## How to Fix

To fix the `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` error, the code must be modified so that the class is imported from the same file that contains the class definition. In the example above, this can be done by importing the `MyClass` class directly from `FileB.js`:

```javascript
// FileB.js
import MyClass from './FileA';

// ...
```

By importing the `MyClass` class directly from `FileA.js`, the language can now determine which file should be imported, and the `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` error will no longer be thrown.

## Conclusion

The `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` error can be confusing to debug, as the code may appear to be correct. However, this error is usually caused by attempting to import a class from a file that is not the same as the file containing the class definition. To fix this error, the code must be modified so that the class is imported from the same file that contains the class definition.

Have you ever encountered the dreaded `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` when trying to import your own class in JavaScript or TypeScript? It can be a tricky one to debug, but don't worry, we'll show you how to fix it.

## What is the `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` Error?

The `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` error occurs when you are trying to import your own class, but the compiler is unable to determine which of the multiple exports you have specified is the correct one to use. This can happen if you have multiple classes with the same name, or if you are trying to import a class that is not exported.

The error message looks like this:

```
SyntaxError: Ambiguous indirect export 'MyClass'
```

## What Causes the `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` Error?

The `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` error is usually caused by a few common mistakes:

* You have multiple classes with the same name.
* You are trying to import a class that is not exported.
* You are using an old version of JavaScript or TypeScript.
* You have a typo in your import statement.

## How to Fix the `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` Error

To fix the `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` error, you need to make sure that you are only importing the class that you want to use, and not any others with the same name.

### 1. Check for Multiple Classes with the Same Name

The first step is to make sure that you don't have multiple classes with the same name. If you do, you need to rename one of the classes so that they are unique.

### 2. Check the Export Statements

Next, you need to make sure that the class you are trying to import is actually exported. Check the export statements in the code to make sure that the class is being exported.

### 3. Update Your JavaScript or TypeScript Version

If you are using an older version of JavaScript or TypeScript, you may be running into an issue that has been fixed in a newer version. Check the release notes for the version you are using to see if there is an update available.

### 4. Check Your Import Statement

Finally, check your import statement to make sure that you don't have any typos. Make sure that the name of the class you are trying to import matches the name of the class in the code.

## Conclusion

The `SyntaxError: Ambiguous Indirect Export` error can be a tricky one to debug, but with the steps outlined above, you should be able to fix it quickly and easily. Just remember to check for multiple classes with the same name, check the export statements, update your JavaScript or TypeScript version, and check your import statement for typos.
