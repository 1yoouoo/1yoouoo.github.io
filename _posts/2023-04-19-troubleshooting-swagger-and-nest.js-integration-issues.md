Integration of Swagger and Nest.js can be a difficult process. This article will provide some troubleshooting tips to help you get your integration working correctly.

The first step in troubleshooting any integration issue is to make sure that all the necessary components are in place. For Swagger and Nest.js integration, you need to have a valid Swagger document, Nest.js server, and Swagger-UI. If any of these components are missing or not configured correctly, you will likely face integration issues.

The next step is to ensure that the Swagger document is valid. If the document is not valid, then it will not be able to be parsed correctly by the Nest.js server. To validate your Swagger document, you can use the Swagger Validator tool. This tool will check the syntax of your document and provide detailed error messages if any errors are found.

Once you have a valid Swagger document, you can begin to integrate it with your Nest.js server. To do this, you will need to install the `@nestjs/swagger` package. This package provides an interface between the Swagger document and the Nest.js server. After installing the package, you will need to add the following code to your main.ts file:

```javascript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { SwaggerModule, DocumentBuilder } from '@nestjs/swagger';

import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

  const options = new DocumentBuilder()
    .setTitle('My API')
    .setDescription('My API description')
    .setVersion('1.0')
    .addTag('my-api')
    .build();
  const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, options);
  SwaggerModule.setup('api', app, document);

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

This code sets up the interface between your Swagger document and Nest.js server. The `DocumentBuilder` class is used to configure the options for the Swagger document. The `SwaggerModule.createDocument()` method is used to create a Swagger document from the options specified in the `DocumentBuilder` instance. Finally, the `SwaggerModule.setup()` method is used to set up the Swagger UI.

Once the interface has been set up, you will need to make sure that the Nest.js server is configured correctly. This includes ensuring that the correct port is being used, and that the API endpoints are correctly configured.

The last step is to check that the Swagger UI is correctly configured. This includes making sure that the correct API base path is being used, and that the correct Swagger document is being used.

If you are still having trouble getting your integration working correctly, then it may be worth contacting the Nest.js or Swagger support teams for further assistance.

Conclusion

Integrating Swagger and Nest.js can be a tricky process, but it is possible to get it working correctly. By following the steps outlined in this article, you should be able to troubleshoot any integration issues that you may be facing. If you are still having trouble, then it may be worth contacting the Nest.js or Swagger support teams for further assistance.

Integrating Swagger and Nest.js can be a tricky process, and it's common to run into issues. In this post, we'll go over a few of the most common issues and provide step-by-step solutions for each.

## Issue 1: Nest.js won't recognize Swagger

The most common issue when integrating Swagger and Nest.js is that Nest.js won't recognize Swagger. This can be caused by a few different things:

- The Swagger configuration is not properly set up.
- The Swagger integration is not properly imported.
- The Swagger integration is not properly registered.

### Solution

To solve this issue, make sure that the Swagger configuration is set up properly, the Swagger integration is imported, and the Swagger integration is registered.

First, set up the Swagger configuration. This is done by creating a configuration file, such as `swagger.config.js`, and adding the following code:

```javascript
const swaggerConfig = {
  swaggerDefinition: {
    info: {
      title: 'My API',
      version: '1.0.0',
    },
    basePath: '/',
    produces: ['application/json'],
    schemes: ['http', 'https'],
  },
  apis: ['./src/**/*.controller.js'],
};

module.exports = swaggerConfig;
```

Next, import the Swagger integration. This is done by adding the following code to the `main.ts` file:

```typescript
import { SwaggerModule, DocumentBuilder } from '@nestjs/swagger';
```

Finally, register the Swagger integration. This is done by adding the following code to the `main.ts` file:

```typescript
const options = new DocumentBuilder()
  .setTitle('My API')
  .setVersion('1.0.0')
  .build();
const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, options);
SwaggerModule.setup('api', app, document);
```

After making these changes, restart the server and the Swagger integration should now be recognized by Nest.js.

## Issue 2: Swagger won't recognize Nest.js endpoints

Another common issue when integrating Swagger and Nest.js is that Swagger won't recognize Nest.js endpoints. This can be caused by a few different things:

- The Swagger integration is not properly imported.
- The Swagger integration is not properly registered.
- The endpoints are not properly decorated with Swagger tags.

### Solution

To solve this issue, make sure that the Swagger integration is imported, registered, and the endpoints are decorated with Swagger tags.

First, make sure that the Swagger integration is imported and registered, as outlined in the previous section.

Next, decorate the endpoints with Swagger tags. This is done by adding the `@ApiTags` decorator to the controller, and the `@ApiOperation` decorator to the endpoint. For example, if you have a `/users` endpoint, you would add the following code:

```typescript
@Controller('users')
@ApiTags('users')
export class UsersController {
  @Get()
  @ApiOperation({ title: 'Get all users' })
  async getUsers() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

After making these changes, restart the server and the Swagger integration should now recognize the Nest.js endpoints.

## Issue 3: Swagger won't render properly

The final common issue when integrating Swagger and Nest.js is that Swagger won't render properly. This can be caused by a few different things:

- The Swagger configuration is not properly set up.
- The Swagger integration is not properly imported.
- The Swagger integration is not properly registered.
- The endpoints are not properly decorated with Swagger tags.

### Solution

To solve this issue, make sure that the Swagger configuration is set up properly, the Swagger integration is imported, registered, and the endpoints are decorated with Swagger tags.

First, set up the Swagger configuration, as outlined in the first section.

Next, make sure that the Swagger integration is imported and registered, as outlined in the first section.

Finally, decorate the endpoints with Swagger tags, as outlined in the second section.

After making these changes, restart the server and the Swagger integration should now render properly.

## Conclusion

Integrating Swagger and Nest.js can be a tricky process, but with the right steps, it can be done. In this post, we've gone over a few of the most common issues and provided step-by-step solutions for each. With the solutions outlined in this post, you should be able to troubleshoot any issues you may encounter when integrating Swagger and Nest.js.
