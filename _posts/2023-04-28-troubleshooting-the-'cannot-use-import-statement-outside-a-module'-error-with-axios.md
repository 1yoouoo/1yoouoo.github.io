If you're using Axios to make HTTP requests in your JavaScript or TypeScript code, you may encounter the error `Cannot use import statement outside a module`. This error occurs when you attempt to use the `import` statement to import a module, but the code is not running inside a module.

In this article, we'll look at the causes of this error and how to fix it. We'll also look at examples of code that will cause this error and how to correct them.

## What Causes the 'Cannot use import statement outside a module' Error?

The `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error occurs when you attempt to use the `import` statement to import a module, but the code is not running inside a module.

In JavaScript and TypeScript, modules are defined using the `export` keyword. When you use the `import` statement, the code is attempting to import a module that has not been defined. This causes the error.

## Common Mistakes

One of the most common mistakes that can cause this error is forgetting to add the `export` keyword to the code. If you forget to add the `export` keyword, the code will not be running inside a module, and the `import` statement will fail.

Another common mistake is attempting to use the `import` statement in a script tag. Script tags do not support modules, so you cannot use the `import` statement inside a script tag.

## Examples of Code That Will Cause This Error

Let's look at some examples of code that will cause this error.

### Example 1

In this example, we have a file called `my-module.js` that contains the following code:

```js
const myFunction = () => {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
};
```

We then attempt to import this module in another file called `app.js`:

```js
import { myFunction } from './my-module';

myFunction();
```

This code will cause the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error because we have not added the `export` keyword to `my-module.js`. To fix this, we need to add the `export` keyword to `my-module.js`:

```js
export const myFunction = () => {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
};
```

### Example 2

In this example, we have a script tag in our HTML file that contains the following code:

```html
<script>
  import { myFunction } from './my-module';
  
  myFunction();
</script>
```

This code will cause the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error because script tags do not support modules. To fix this, we need to move the code into a separate JavaScript file and use the `<script>` tag to include it in the HTML file:

```html
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

```js
// app.js
import { myFunction } from './my-module';

myFunction();
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we looked at the causes of the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error and how to fix it. We also looked at some examples of code that will cause this error and how to correct them.

When using Axios, you may encounter an error that reads, `Cannot use import statement outside a module`. This error can be confusing and frustrating, but once you understand the cause and how to fix it, the error can be resolved quickly.

In this blog post, we will discuss what causes this error and how to fix it. We will also provide examples of code that can help you understand the issue and resolve it.

## What Causes the Error?

The error `Cannot use import statement outside a module` occurs when you try to import a file or module in a JavaScript or TypeScript file that is not part of a module. This means that the file you are trying to import is not a JavaScript or TypeScript file, or it is not part of a module.

When you try to import a file or module that is not part of a module, the JavaScript or TypeScript compiler will throw an error. This error is caused because the JavaScript or TypeScript compiler does not recognize the import statement.

## How to Fix the Error

The first step to fixing the error is to determine why the import statement is not recognized. The most common cause of this error is that the file you are trying to import is not a JavaScript or TypeScript file, or it is not part of a module.

If the file you are trying to import is not a JavaScript or TypeScript file, you will need to convert it to a JavaScript or TypeScript file. This can be done using a text editor or an online tool such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

If the file you are trying to import is part of a module, you will need to make sure that the module is installed and configured correctly. This can be done by running `npm install` or `yarn install` in the terminal.

Once the file is converted to a JavaScript or TypeScript file, or the module is installed and configured correctly, you can then use the import statement to import the file or module.

## Examples

Here are some examples of code that can help you understand the issue and resolve it.

### Example 1

In this example, we are trying to import a file named `myFile.js` that is not part of a module.

```javascript
import myFile from './myFile';
```

This code will cause the error `Cannot use import statement outside a module`. To fix this error, we need to convert `myFile.js` to a JavaScript or TypeScript file. This can be done using a text editor or an online tool such as Babel.

### Example 2

In this example, we are trying to import a module named `myModule`.

```javascript
import myModule from 'myModule';
```

This code will cause the error `Cannot use import statement outside a module`. To fix this error, we need to make sure that the module is installed and configured correctly. This can be done by running `npm install` or `yarn install` in the terminal.

## Conclusion

The `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error can be confusing and frustrating to deal with. However, once you understand the cause and how to fix it, the error can be resolved quickly.
