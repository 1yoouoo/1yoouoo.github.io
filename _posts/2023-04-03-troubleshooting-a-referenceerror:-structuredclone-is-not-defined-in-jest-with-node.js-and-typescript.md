When working with Node.js and TypeScript, you may encounter a ReferenceError that reads `structuredClone is not defined`. This error occurs when the `structuredClone` function is used in a Jest test, but not defined in the code. This can be a frustrating error to debug, as it can be difficult to determine exactly what is causing the issue. In this article, we will discuss the cause of this error, how to troubleshoot it, and how to prevent it from occurring in the future.

## What is the Cause of This Error?

The `structuredClone` function is used in Jest tests to create a deep copy of an object. If the `structuredClone` function is not defined, then the test will fail with the ReferenceError `structuredClone is not defined`. This error is caused by a missing or incorrect definition of the `structuredClone` function in the code.

## How to Troubleshoot This Error

To troubleshoot this error, the first step is to check if the `structuredClone` function is defined in the code. If it is not, then you will need to define it. To do this, you will need to add the following code to your test file:

```javascript
const structuredClone = obj => {
  return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
};
```

This code creates a deep copy of an object, which is necessary for the `structuredClone` function to work correctly. Once this code is added to the test file, the `structuredClone` function will be defined and the ReferenceError should be resolved.

If the `structuredClone` function is already defined in the code, then you will need to check if it is defined correctly. To do this, you will need to check the syntax of the code and ensure that it is valid. For example, if the code is written in TypeScript, then you will need to check if the types of the parameters and return values are correct.

## How to Prevent This Error from Occurring

To prevent this error from occurring in the future, it is important to ensure that the `structuredClone` function is defined correctly in the code. This can be done by adding the code snippet provided above to your test file, or by checking the syntax of the code if it is already defined. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the types of the parameters and return values are correct if the code is written in TypeScript.

By following these steps, you should be able to prevent this error from occurring in the future.

## Conclusion

When working with Node.js and TypeScript, you may encounter a ReferenceError that reads `structuredClone is not defined`. This error occurs when the `structuredClone` function is used in a Jest test, but not defined in the code. To troubleshoot this error, the first step is to check if the `structuredClone` function is defined in the code. If it is not, then you will need to define it by adding the code snippet provided above to your test file. If the `structuredClone` function is already defined, then you will need to check if it is defined correctly. To prevent this error from occurring in the future, it is important to ensure that the `structuredClone` function is defined correctly in the code.

If you are developing an application with Node.js and TypeScript, you may have encountered a ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined error in Jest. This error can be caused by a number of different issues, and can be difficult to troubleshoot. In this post, we will discuss what this error means, and provide step-by-step instructions for resolving it.

## What Does the Error Mean?

The ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined error is a TypeError that is thrown when the JavaScript engine is unable to find a definition for the structuredClone function. This function is used to make a deep copy of an object or array, which is necessary for certain operations. If the function cannot be found, the engine will throw an error.

## Troubleshooting the Error

The first step in troubleshooting this error is to determine where it is being thrown. If you are using Jest, you can use the `--verbose` flag to get more information about the error. This will tell you the exact line of code where the error is being thrown.

Once you have identified the line of code where the error is being thrown, you can start to troubleshoot the issue. The most common cause of this error is a missing or incorrect import statement. If you are importing a module or library that contains the structuredClone function, make sure that the import statement is correct and that the module is installed in your project.

If you are not importing a module or library, the error can be caused by a typo in the code. Make sure that you are using the correct syntax for the structuredClone function, and that all of the parameters are spelled correctly.

Finally, if you are using TypeScript, make sure that the type definitions for the structuredClone function are included in your project. This can be done by installing the `@types/node` package, which contains type definitions for all of the Node.js core modules.

## Example Code

Below is an example of how to use the structuredClone function in Node.js and TypeScript:

```typescript
import { structuredClone } from 'node';

const obj = {
  foo: 'bar',
  baz: 'qux'
};

const clonedObj = structuredClone(obj);
```

In this example, we are importing the structuredClone function from the Node.js core module, and then using it to make a deep copy of an object. The cloned object will have the same properties and values as the original object, but will be stored in a different location in memory.

## Conclusion

The ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined error can be a difficult error to troubleshoot, but with the right steps it can be resolved quickly. Make sure that any modules or libraries that contain the structuredClone function are correctly imported, and that all of the parameters are spelled correctly. If you are using TypeScript, make sure that the type definitions for the structuredClone function are included in your project. With these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and get your application running again.
