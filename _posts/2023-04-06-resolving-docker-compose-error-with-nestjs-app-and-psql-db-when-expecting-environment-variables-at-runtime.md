When attempting to run a NestJS application with a PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose, it is possible to encounter an error where the application is expecting environment variables at runtime, but none are found. This issue can be caused by a variety of different factors, ranging from incorrect configuration of the environment variables to miscommunication between the application and the database. In this article, we will discuss the causes of this error, as well as some potential solutions.

## Common Mistakes

When attempting to run a NestJS application with a PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose, it is possible to encounter an error where the application is expecting environment variables at runtime, but none are found. This issue can be caused by a variety of different factors, but some of the most common mistakes that can lead to this error include:

- Incorrectly configured environment variables: When setting up the environment variables for the application, it is important to ensure that they are all correctly configured. This includes making sure that the variables are properly named, as well as setting the correct values.

- Miscommunication between the application and the database: The application and the database must be able to communicate with each other in order to properly function. If there is an issue with the communication between the two, then this can lead to the application expecting environment variables at runtime, but none being found.

- Incorrectly configured Docker Compose file: The Docker Compose file is responsible for setting up the environment for the application and the database. If the configuration of the file is incorrect, then this can lead to the application expecting environment variables at runtime, but none being found.

## Resolving the Issue

In order to resolve the issue of the application expecting environment variables at runtime, but none being found, it is important to first identify the root cause of the issue. Once the root cause has been identified, then it is possible to begin working on resolving the problem.

### Checking the Environment Variables

The first step in resolving the issue is to check the environment variables. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
$ printenv
```

This command will print out all of the environment variables that are currently set. It is important to ensure that all of the environment variables that the application is expecting are present, as well as that they are set to the correct values.

### Checking the Docker Compose File

The next step is to check the Docker Compose file. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
$ docker-compose config
```

This command will print out the configuration of the Docker Compose file. It is important to ensure that the configuration is correct and that all of the necessary environment variables are present.

### Checking the Database Connection

The final step is to check the database connection. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
$ psql -U <username> -h <host> -p <port>
```

This command will connect to the database and allow you to check the connection. It is important to ensure that the connection is successful, as this will indicate that the application and the database are able to communicate with each other.

## Conclusion

When attempting to run a NestJS application with a PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose, it is possible to encounter an error where the application is expecting environment variables at runtime, but none are found. This issue can be caused by a variety of different factors, ranging from incorrect configuration of the environment variables to miscommunication between the application and the database. In order to resolve the issue, it is important to first identify the root cause of the issue and then take the necessary steps to resolve it. This can include checking the environment variables, checking the Docker Compose file, and checking the database connection.

Developers often face issues when working with Docker Compose and NestJS applications. A common issue is when the application is expecting environment variables at runtime, but the Docker Compose configuration is not set up properly to provide them. This can lead to errors when running the application, making it difficult to debug and resolve. 

In this blog post, we'll walk through the process of resolving this error when using a NestJS application and a PostgreSQL database. We'll look at how to properly set up your Docker Compose configuration to provide the necessary environment variables, as well as how to debug the issue to ensure that everything is configured correctly. 

## Setting Up the Environment Variables in Docker Compose

The first step in resolving this issue is to ensure that the environment variables are properly set up in the Docker Compose configuration. This can be done by adding a `.env` file to the root of the project and specifying the environment variables that are needed. 

For example, if you are using a PostgreSQL database, you will need to set the `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` environment variables. 

```
POSTGRES_HOST=db
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
```

Once the `.env` file is created and the environment variables are specified, the next step is to add the `environment` section to the `docker-compose.yml` file. This section will allow the environment variables to be passed to the application container when running the Docker Compose command. 

For example, the following configuration will pass the environment variables from the `.env` file to the application container: 

```
version: '3.7'
services:
  app:
    image: node:latest
    environment:
        - POSTGRES_HOST=${POSTGRES_HOST}
        - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
        - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
        - POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}
```

Once the `environment` section is added, the environment variables will be passed to the application container when running the `docker-compose up` command. 

## Debugging the Issue

Once the environment variables are set up, it's important to debug the issue to ensure that everything is configured correctly. The first step is to check the application logs to see if there are any errors related to the environment variables. 

If there are errors related to the environment variables, it's likely that the environment variables are not being passed to the application container. To check this, use the `docker-compose exec` command to access the application container and run the `env` command to see the environment variables that are set. 

If the environment variables are not present, it's likely that the `environment` section was not properly configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file. To check this, use the `docker-compose config` command to view the configuration that is being used. This will allow you to verify that the `environment` section is properly set up. 

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we looked at how to resolve the Docker Compose error when using a NestJS application and a PostgreSQL database. We looked at how to properly set up the environment variables in the Docker Compose configuration, as well as how to debug the issue to ensure that everything is configured correctly. 

By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you should be able to successfully resolve the Docker Compose error and get your application up and running.
