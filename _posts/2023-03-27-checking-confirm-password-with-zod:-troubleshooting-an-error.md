When developing an application with Zod, developers may encounter an error when attempting to check a user's confirm password. This error can be caused by a variety of mistakes and can be difficult to debug. In this post, we will discuss some of the most common mistakes that can lead to this error, as well as provide examples of how to fix them.

## Common Mistakes
When checking a user's confirm password, it is important to ensure that the two passwords match. This is typically done by comparing the two passwords using a comparison operator such as `===` or `==`. However, if the two passwords are not of the same type, the comparison operator will return `false` even if the two passwords match. For example, if the first password is a string and the second is a number, the comparison operator will return `false` even if the two passwords are identical.

Another common mistake is forgetting to hash the user's password before comparing it. When a user creates an account, their password is typically hashed for security purposes. When checking the confirm password, the same hashing algorithm should be used to ensure that the two passwords match.

## Fixing the Error
To fix the error, developers should first ensure that the two passwords are of the same type. This can be done by using the `typeof` operator to check the type of each password. If the two passwords are not of the same type, developers should convert them to the same type before comparing them.

Once the two passwords are of the same type, developers should then use a hashing algorithm to hash the user's password before comparing it. For example, if the user's password is `password123`, it should be hashed using a hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 before comparing it with the confirm password.

```javascript
// Hash the user's password
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');
hash.update(password);
const hashedPassword = hash.digest('hex');

// Compare the two passwords
if (hashedPassword === confirmPassword) {
  // Passwords match
} else {
  // Passwords do not match
}
```

Finally, developers should also ensure that the same hashing algorithm is used when comparing the two passwords. If a different hashing algorithm is used, the two passwords will not match even if they are identical.

## Conclusion
When developing an application with Zod, developers may encounter an error when attempting to check a user's confirm password. This error can be caused by a variety of mistakes, including comparing two passwords of different types and forgetting to hash the user's password before comparing it. To fix the error, developers should ensure that the two passwords are of the same type, hash the user's password using a hashing algorithm, and ensure that the same hashing algorithm is used when comparing the two passwords.

When working with forms, it is important to check that the user has correctly entered the same password in both the `password` and `confirm_password` fields. In this blog post, we will look at how to troubleshoot an error with Zod when checking the confirm password field.

## Overview

Zod is a type-safe validation library for JavaScript and TypeScript. It is designed to make form validation simpler and easier to use. With Zod, you can define the validation rules for a form and then validate the form data against those rules.

When checking a confirm password field, Zod can throw an error if the two passwords do not match. This error can be difficult to troubleshoot and can be caused by a variety of issues. In this blog post, we will look at how to troubleshoot this error and get your form validation working correctly.

## Step 1: Check the Input Types

The first step in troubleshooting the confirm password error is to check the input types of the `password` and `confirm_password` fields. If the types of the two fields are different, the validation will fail. For example, if the `password` field is a `string` and the `confirm_password` field is an `integer`, the validation will fail.

To ensure that the input types of the two fields are the same, you can use the `typeof` operator. For example, the following code checks that the `password` and `confirm_password` fields are both strings:

```javascript
const isString = (value) => typeof value === 'string';

if (!isString(password) || !isString(confirmPassword)) {
  throw new TypeError('password and confirmPassword must be strings!');
}
```

## Step 2: Check the Input Values

The next step in troubleshooting the confirm password error is to check the input values of the `password` and `confirm_password` fields. If the values of the two fields are different, the validation will fail.

To ensure that the input values of the two fields are the same, you can use the `===` operator. For example, the following code checks that the `password` and `confirm_password` fields are the same:

```javascript
if (password !== confirmPassword) {
  throw new Error('password and confirmPassword must be the same!');
}
```

## Step 3: Check the Input Lengths

The final step in troubleshooting the confirm password error is to check the input lengths of the `password` and `confirm_password` fields. If the lengths of the two fields are different, the validation will fail.

To ensure that the input lengths of the two fields are the same, you can use the `length` property. For example, the following code checks that the `password` and `confirm_password` fields are the same length:

```javascript
if (password.length !== confirmPassword.length) {
  throw new Error('password and confirmPassword must be the same length!');
}
```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we looked at how to troubleshoot an error with Zod when checking the confirm password field. We discussed how to check the input types, values, and lengths of the `password` and `confirm_password` fields to ensure that the validation will pass.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your form validation is working correctly and that the user has correctly entered the same password in both the `password` and `confirm_password` fields.
