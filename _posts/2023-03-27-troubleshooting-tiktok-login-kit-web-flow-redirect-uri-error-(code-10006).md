TikTok Login Kit Web Flow Redirect URI Error (Code 10006) is an error that developers may encounter when attempting to log into their TikTok account using the Login Kit Web Flow feature. This error occurs when the redirect URI provided by the developer does not match the one registered in the TikTok developer portal. The error message typically reads “Error: redirect_uri_mismatch, Please check your redirect_uri”.

In order to troubleshoot this issue, developers must first ensure that the redirect URI provided in the Login Kit Web Flow is the same as the one registered in the TikTok developer portal. The redirect URI is a unique identifier that is provided by the developer and registered in the TikTok developer portal. It is used to direct the user back to the application after the user has logged in with their TikTok account.

In order to ensure that the redirect URI is correct, developers must first check the settings in the TikTok developer portal. The developer must ensure that the redirect URI registered in the portal matches the one provided in the Login Kit Web Flow. If the redirect URI is incorrect, the developer must update the settings in the TikTok developer portal to match the one provided in the Login Kit Web Flow.

In addition, developers must also ensure that the redirect URI is properly encoded. The redirect URI must be URL-encoded in order for it to be properly recognized by the TikTok Login Kit Web Flow. If the redirect URI is not properly encoded, the user will not be redirected back to the application and the error message will be displayed.

The following is an example of a properly encoded redirect URI:

```javascript
let redirect_uri = encodeURIComponent("https://example.com/redirect");
```

In this example, the redirect URI is encoded using the JavaScript `encodeURIComponent` function. This ensures that the redirect URI is properly encoded and can be recognized by the TikTok Login Kit Web Flow.

Another common mistake that developers make is not providing the full redirect URI in the Login Kit Web Flow. The redirect URI must include the protocol (e.g., http:// or https://) as well as the domain name. If the protocol or domain name is not provided, the user will not be redirected back to the application and the error message will be displayed.

The following is an example of a properly formatted redirect URI:

```javascript
let redirect_uri = "https://example.com/redirect";
```

In this example, the redirect URI includes the protocol (https://) as well as the domain name (example.com). This ensures that the user will be redirected back to the application after logging in with their TikTok account.

Finally, developers must also ensure that the redirect URI is registered with the TikTok developer portal. The redirect URI must be registered with the portal in order for it to be recognized by the Login Kit Web Flow. If the redirect URI is not registered with the portal, the user will not be redirected back to the application and the error message will be displayed.

In conclusion, TikTok Login Kit Web Flow Redirect URI Error (Code 10006) is an error that developers may encounter when attempting to log into their TikTok account using the Login Kit Web Flow feature. In order to troubleshoot this issue, developers must first ensure that the redirect URI provided in the Login Kit Web Flow is the same as the one registered in the TikTok developer portal. In addition, developers must also ensure that the redirect URI is properly encoded and that the full redirect URI is provided in the Login Kit Web Flow. Finally, developers must also ensure that the redirect URI is registered with the TikTok developer portal.
