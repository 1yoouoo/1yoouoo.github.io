CSS Custom Properties, also known as CSS Variables, are a powerful tool for styling webpages. They allow developers to create dynamic styles that can be changed on the fly, giving developers the ability to create complex and responsive designs. However, when using CSS Custom Properties, developers can run into errors when trying to use them in a conditional way. In this article, we'll look at some of the common mistakes developers make when using CSS Custom Properties, as well as how to troubleshoot them.

## Common Mistakes

One of the most common mistakes developers make when using CSS Custom Properties is not understanding how they work. CSS Custom Properties are not like other CSS properties, in that they do not have a fixed value, but instead can be set and changed at any time. This means that when using them for conditionals, developers must be sure to set the value of the property before attempting to use it.

Another common mistake is not understanding the scope of CSS Custom Properties. CSS Custom Properties are scoped to the element they are declared on, and can only be accessed from within the same element or its children. This means that if you are trying to use a CSS Custom Property in a conditional on a parent element, it will not be accessible.

## Troubleshooting

When troubleshooting errors with CSS Custom Properties, the first step is to make sure the property is set before attempting to use it in a conditional. To do this, you can use the `getPropertyValue()` function, which will return the value of the property, or `null` if it is not set.

```js
const myPropertyValue = getComputedStyle(element).getPropertyValue('--my-property');

if (myPropertyValue !== null) {
  // Property is set, so use it in your conditional
}
```

If the property is set, the next step is to make sure it is in the correct scope. To do this, you can use the `getPropertyPriority()` function, which will return the priority of the property as either `important` or `null`.

```js
const myPropertyPriority = getComputedStyle(element).getPropertyPriority('--my-property');

if (myPropertyPriority === 'important') {
  // Property is in the correct scope, so use it in your conditional
}
```

If the property is not in the correct scope, you can use the `setProperty()` function to set the property on the correct element.

```js
element.style.setProperty('--my-property', 'value', 'important');
```

Finally, if you are still running into errors, you can check the browser's developer console to see if there are any errors being thrown. The console will usually provide helpful information that can help you pinpoint the exact issue.

## Conclusion

Troubleshooting errors with CSS Custom Properties can be difficult, but with the right tools and understanding of how they work, developers can quickly identify and fix any issues. By making sure the property is set, checking the scope, and using the browser's developer console, developers can quickly identify and fix any issues they may have.

CSS custom properties, also known as CSS variables, are a powerful tool for adding dynamic styling to web pages. It allows developers to store values in variables that can be used in multiple places throughout the stylesheet. This makes it easy to add conditional styling based on the value of these variables.

However, when working with CSS custom properties, it's not always easy to troubleshoot errors. In this post, we'll look at some common issues that can arise when using conditional styling with CSS custom properties and how to resolve them.

## Defining CSS Variables

The first step in using CSS custom properties is to define the variables. This is done using the `var()` function. The `var()` function takes two arguments: the name of the variable and the value of the variable.

For example, to define a variable called `--main-color` with the value `#f00`, you would use the following code:

```css
:root {
  --main-color: #f00;
}
```

The `:root` selector is used to ensure that the variable is available throughout the entire document.

## Using CSS Variables

Once the variables have been defined, they can be used in the stylesheet. This is done using the `var()` function again, but this time with only one argument: the name of the variable.

For example, if you wanted to set the background color of an element to the value of the `--main-color` variable, you would use the following code:

```css
.element {
  background-color: var(--main-color);
}
```

## Conditional Styling with CSS Variables

CSS variables can also be used to create conditional styling. This is done by using the `calc()` function to compare the value of the variable to a specific value.

For example, if you wanted to set the font size of an element to `14px` if the value of the `--main-color` variable is `#f00`, you would use the following code:

```css
.element {
  font-size: calc(var(--main-color) == #f00 ? 14px : 16px);
}
```

In this example, the `calc()` function is used to compare the value of the `--main-color` variable to the value `#f00`. If the comparison evaluates to `true`, the font size is set to `14px`. If the comparison evaluates to `false`, the font size is set to `16px`.

## Troubleshooting Conditional Styling Errors

When working with conditional styling, it's not uncommon to run into errors. Here are some common errors and how to troubleshoot them:

### Variable Not Defined

If you get an error stating that the variable has not been defined, it means that the variable has not been declared in the stylesheet. To fix this, make sure that the variable has been properly declared using the `var()` function.

### Variable Not Found

If you get an error stating that the variable cannot be found, it means that the variable has not been declared in the correct scope. To fix this, make sure that the variable has been declared in the correct scope using the `:root` selector.

### Comparison Not Evaluating

If you get an error stating that the comparison is not evaluating, it means that the comparison is not correctly formatted. To fix this, make sure that the comparison is correctly formatted using the `calc()` function.

### Incorrect Syntax

If you get an error stating that the syntax is incorrect, it means that the syntax is not correctly formatted. To fix this, make sure that the syntax is correctly formatted and that all the necessary arguments are included.

### Incorrect Values

If you get an error stating that the values are incorrect, it means that the values are not correctly formatted. To fix this, make sure that the values are correctly formatted and that they match the expected values.

### Incorrect Operators

If you get an error stating that the operators are incorrect, it means that the operators are not correctly formatted. To fix this, make sure that the operators are correctly formatted and that they match the expected operators.

### Other Errors

If you encounter any other errors when working with conditional styling, make sure to check the syntax of the code and make sure that all the necessary arguments are included.

## Conclusion

Troubleshooting errors with CSS custom properties can be difficult. However, by following the steps outlined above, you should be able to quickly identify and resolve any errors that may arise.
