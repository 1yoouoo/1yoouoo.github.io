When developing custom commands for Cypress, it is important to ensure that the code is written in a way that is type-safe and error-free. Typescript is a popular language for developing custom commands, as it provides the ability to declare types for variables and functions. This ensures that the code is more reliable and easier to debug. However, when using Typescript in combination with ESLint, there are some issues that can arise. In this article, we will discuss how to declare types for custom commands in Typescript-ESLint and some common mistakes to avoid.

## What is Typescript?

Typescript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It adds features such as static typing, classes, and interfaces to the language. This makes it a great choice for developing custom commands for Cypress, as it allows for more reliable code. It also provides the ability to declare types for variables and functions, which can help to reduce errors.

## What is ESLint?

ESLint is a popular linting tool for JavaScript and Typescript. It is used to detect errors in code and provide feedback to the developer. It is also used to enforce coding standards and conventions. When using ESLint with Typescript, it is important to ensure that the correct rules are enabled in order to avoid any issues.

## Declaring Types

When declaring types in Typescript, it is important to use the correct syntax. For example, if you want to declare a variable as a string, you should use the following syntax:

```typescript
let myString: string;
```

Similarly, if you want to declare a function as a number, you should use the following syntax:

```typescript
let myFunction: (arg1: number) => number;
```

It is also important to note that the types should be declared in the same order as the arguments. For example, if you have a function with two arguments, the first argument should be declared as a string and the second argument should be declared as a number.

## Common Mistakes

When declaring types for custom commands in Typescript-ESLint, there are some common mistakes that can lead to errors. One of the most common mistakes is forgetting to declare the types. This can lead to errors such as "TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined". To avoid this, make sure to always declare the types for all variables and functions. 

Another common mistake is not enabling the correct ESLint rules. For example, if you are using Typescript with ESLint, you should make sure to enable the "Typescript" rule. This rule will help to ensure that the types are declared correctly and will help to avoid any errors. 

Finally, it is important to remember that Typescript is a superset of JavaScript, so you should not use any JavaScript features that are not supported by Typescript. For example, do not use the `var` keyword when declaring variables, as this is not supported in Typescript.

## Conclusion

Declaring types for custom commands in Typescript-ESLint is an important step in ensuring that the code is reliable and error-free. It is important to use the correct syntax when declaring types and to enable the correct ESLint rules. Additionally, it is important to remember that Typescript is a superset of JavaScript, so you should not use any JavaScript features that are not supported in Typescript. By following these tips, you can ensure that your custom commands will be more reliable and easier to debug.

Developers who use Cypress and Typescript-ESLint often encounter a common issue: how to declare types for their custom commands. This issue can be tricky to resolve, as the custom commands are not automatically type-checked by Typescript-ESLint. In this blog post, we will discuss the steps needed to properly declare types for custom commands in Typescript-ESLint.

## Step 1: Create a File for Your Custom Commands

The first step is to create a file for your custom commands. This file should be placed in the same directory as your `cypress.json` file. The file should be named `custom-commands.ts` and should contain the following code:

```typescript
import { Command } from 'cypress';

export const customCommands: { [key: string]: Command } = {
  // Add your custom commands here
};
```

This code will create an object containing all of your custom commands. Each command should be added to this object with a key that is the name of the command. For example, if you have a command called `login`, you would add it to the `customCommands` object like this:

```typescript
export const customCommands: { [key: string]: Command } = {
  login: (username: string, password: string) => {
    // Login logic goes here
  },
};
```

## Step 2: Create a Type Declaration for Your Custom Commands

The next step is to create a type declaration for your custom commands. This type declaration should be placed in the same directory as your `custom-commands.ts` file. The file should be named `custom-commands.d.ts` and should contain the following code:

```typescript
import { Command } from 'cypress';

declare module 'cypress' {
  interface CustomCommands {
    // Add type declarations for your custom commands here
  }
}
```

This code will create an interface containing the type declarations for your custom commands. Each command should be added to this interface with the same name as the key used in the `customCommands` object. For example, if you have a command called `login`, you would add it to the `CustomCommands` interface like this:

```typescript
declare module 'cypress' {
  interface CustomCommands {
    login: (username: string, password: string) => void;
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Add Your Custom Commands to Cypress

The final step is to add your custom commands to Cypress. This can be done by adding the following code to your `cypress/support/index.js` file:

```javascript
import { customCommands } from '../custom-commands';

Cypress.Commands.add('custom', customCommands);
```

This code will add all of your custom commands to Cypress, allowing them to be used in your tests.

## Conclusion

Declaring types for custom commands in Cypress and Typescript-ESLint can be a tricky process. However, by following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily declare types for your custom commands and ensure that they are properly type-checked. With the proper type declarations in place, you can be confident that your custom commands are working as expected and your code is free from type errors.
