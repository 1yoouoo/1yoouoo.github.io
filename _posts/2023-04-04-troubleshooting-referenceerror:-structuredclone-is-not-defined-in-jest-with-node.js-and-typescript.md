When working with Node.js and TypeScript, you may encounter the error `ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined` when running tests with Jest. This error can be particularly frustrating to debug, as it does not provide any helpful information about the source of the error. In this article, we will look at why this error occurs and how to fix it.

## What is the Error?

The `ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined` error occurs when running tests with Jest in a Node.js and TypeScript project. This error indicates that Jest is unable to find the `structuredClone` function, which is used to serialize and deserialize objects. Without this function, Jest will not be able to run tests.

## Common Mistakes

When troubleshooting this error, there are a few common mistakes to look out for. First, make sure that you have installed the `@types/jest` package. This package contains the necessary type definitions for Jest, and is required for Jest to run tests in a TypeScript project.

Another common mistake is forgetting to include the `ts-jest` preprocessor in your Jest configuration. The `ts-jest` preprocessor is responsible for transpiling TypeScript code into JavaScript, which is necessary for Jest to run tests. Make sure that you have included the `ts-jest` preprocessor in your Jest configuration.

Finally, make sure that you are using the correct version of TypeScript. Jest only supports TypeScript versions 2.6 and higher, so make sure that you are using a compatible version.

## Example

Let's look at an example of how to fix this error. In this example, we will be using the following environment:

- Node.js: 12.x
- TypeScript: 3.7.x
- Jest: 26.x

First, we will install the necessary packages. We will need to install `@types/jest` and `ts-jest`, as well as the TypeScript compiler:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/jest ts-jest typescript
```

Next, we need to configure Jest to use the `ts-jest` preprocessor. We can do this by adding the following to our `jest.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
};
```

Finally, we need to make sure that we are using a compatible version of TypeScript. We can do this by adding the following to our `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["es6"],
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node"
  }
}
```

Once we have completed these steps, we should be able to run our tests without any errors.

## Conclusion

In this article, we looked at how to troubleshoot the `ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined` error when using Jest with Node.js and TypeScript. We discussed some common mistakes to look out for, as well as an example of how to fix the error. With these tips, you should be able to quickly and easily fix this error and get back to running your tests.

When developing applications with Node.js and TypeScript, you may encounter an error that says `ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined`. This error can be confusing and frustrating, as it is not always clear what is causing it. In this article, we will look at what this error means, and how to troubleshoot and resolve it.

## What is the `ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined` Error?

The `ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined` error occurs when a type or variable is not defined in the code. This can happen when the code is referencing a type or variable that is not defined, or when the code is referencing a type or variable that is defined in a different file.

## How to Troubleshoot and Resolve the Error

To troubleshoot and resolve the `ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined` error, you will need to identify the type or variable that is not defined. This can be done by using the `console.log` method to log the type or variable in the code. Once the type or variable is identified, you can then add the necessary code to define it.

For example, if the error is occurring when the code is referencing a type or variable `foo`, you can add the following code to define it:

```javascript
let foo = {
  bar: 'baz'
};
```

Once the type or variable is defined, the `ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined` error should be resolved.

## Conclusion

The `ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined` error can be confusing and frustrating, as it is not always clear what is causing it. In this article, we looked at what this error means, and how to troubleshoot and resolve it. We also discussed how to use the `console.log` method to identify the type or variable that is not defined, and how to add the necessary code to define it. By following the steps outlined in this article, you should be able to resolve the `ReferenceError: structuredClone is not defined` error.
