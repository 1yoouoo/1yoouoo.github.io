If you're developing a React Single Page Application (SPA) using [React-SPA-Prerender](https://github.com/markdalgleish/react-spa-prerender), you may encounter class duplication errors. These errors can be difficult to diagnose and fix, but this guide will provide tips and best practices to help you troubleshoot and resolve them.

## What Causes Class Duplication Errors?

Class duplication errors are caused when two or more classes are declared with the same name in the same scope. This can happen when a class is declared both in the root component and in a child component. If a class is declared in both locations, React-SPA-Prerender will not be able to properly render the page, resulting in an error.

## Common Mistakes

There are several common mistakes that can lead to class duplication errors. One of the most common is declaring a class in both the root component and a child component. This can happen if the same class is declared in both the root component and a child component, or if a class is declared in a child component that has already been declared in the root component.

Another common mistake is declaring a class in a component that is rendered multiple times. This can happen if a component is rendered multiple times in the same page, or if a component is rendered multiple times in the same page with different props.

Finally, class duplication errors can occur if a component is rendered with different props in different contexts. For example, if a component is rendered with different props in a development environment and a production environment, the class names may not match, resulting in a class duplication error.

## Example Code

The following code example demonstrates a class duplication error caused by declaring a class in both the root component and a child component.

```javascript
// Root component
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ChildComponent />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Child component
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Child component</div>;
  }
}
```

In this example, the same class (`MyComponent`) is declared in both the root component and the child component. As a result, React-SPA-Prerender will not be able to properly render the page, resulting in a class duplication error.

## Best Practices

To avoid class duplication errors, it is important to follow best practices when declaring classes in React components.

First, make sure that each class is only declared once in the same scope. If a class is declared in both the root component and a child component, only declare it in the root component.

Second, make sure that a component is only rendered once. If a component is rendered multiple times with different props, consider using the `key` prop to ensure that each instance of the component has a unique key.

Finally, make sure that a component is rendered with the same props in all contexts. If a component is rendered with different props in a development environment and a production environment, consider using environment variables to ensure that the props are the same in both environments.

## Conclusion

Class duplication errors can be difficult to diagnose and fix, but following best practices can help you avoid them. Make sure that each class is only declared once in the same scope, that a component is only rendered once, and that a component is rendered with the same props in all contexts. By following these best practices, you can ensure that React-SPA-Prerender will be able to properly render your page.

If you're working with React, single-page apps (SPAs), and pre-rendering, you may have encountered a class duplication error. This error is caused when React attempts to render two or more classes with the same name. It can be difficult to debug, but there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue. 

## What Causes Class Duplication Errors? 

Class duplication errors are caused when two React components are trying to render the same class. This can happen when you're using pre-rendering, which is when a page is rendered in advance and stored as a static HTML file. When a user visits the page, they receive the pre-rendered version, instead of it being generated by React on the fly. 

The problem arises when the same class is used in two different components. When React attempts to render the page, it will see two classes with the same name and throw an error. 

## How to Troubleshoot the Error 

The first step in troubleshooting the class duplication error is to identify the components that are using the same class. To do this, open the React DevTools and go to the Components tab.

The Components tab will show you all the components that are being rendered on the page. Look through each component and look for the class name that is causing the duplication error. Once you've found the class, you can identify which components are using it. 

The next step is to find out why the class is being used in two different components. This could be because you've imported the same class into two different files, or because you've used the same class name in two different components. 

Once you've identified the cause of the duplication error, you can start to work on a solution. You may need to rename the class, or move it into a different file. 

## Example Code 

Here's an example of code that will cause a class duplication error. 

#### File 1: 

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div className="my-component">My Component</div>;
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

#### File 2: 

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div className="my-component">My Component 2</div>;
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, both files are importing and exporting the same class, which will cause a class duplication error. To fix this, you can rename one of the classes, or move it into a different file. 

## Conclusion 

Class duplication errors can be difficult to debug, but with the right steps, you can troubleshoot the issue and find a solution. Start by identifying the components that are using the same class, then find out why the class is being used in multiple components. Once you've identified the cause of the error, you can work on a solution. This could involve renaming the class, or moving it into a different file. With the right steps, you can quickly troubleshoot the class duplication error and get your React app up and running again.
