## Common Mistakes and Reasons for the Error

There are a couple of common mistakes that may lead to the "InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor" error in TypeORM. These include:

1. **Incorrect import of the `InsertQueryBuilder` class**: This error might occur when you import the `InsertQueryBuilder` class incorrectly, which then results in an invalid constructor call.

2. **Using an outdated version of TypeORM**: Another reason for this error could be that you are using an outdated version of TypeORM, which might not have the `InsertQueryBuilder` class or might have an issue with it.

Let's dive deeper into each of these mistakes and explore how to resolve them.

### Incorrect Import of the InsertQueryBuilder Class

When working with TypeORM, you may need to use the `InsertQueryBuilder` class to construct and execute complex insert queries. However, if you import this class incorrectly, you might encounter the "InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor" error.

To demonstrate this, let's look at the following incorrect code example:

```javascript
import { InsertQueryBuilder } from 'typeorm/query-builder/InsertQueryBuilder';

const queryBuilder = new InsertQueryBuilderCls(connection);
```

In the code above, we have imported the `InsertQueryBuilder` class incorrectly. The correct import statement should look like this:

```javascript
import { InsertQueryBuilder } from 'typeorm';
```

To resolve this error, make sure that you are importing the `InsertQueryBuilder` class from the correct module. The corrected code should look like this:

```javascript
import { InsertQueryBuilder } from 'typeorm';

const queryBuilder = new InsertQueryBuilder(connection);
```

### Using an Outdated Version of TypeORM

Another reason for the "InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor" error could be that you are using an outdated version of TypeORM. It is essential to ensure that you are using the latest version of TypeORM to avoid any compatibility issues or missing features.

To check your current version of TypeORM, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm list typeorm
```

If you find that you are using an outdated version, update TypeORM by running:

```bash
npm install typeorm@latest
```

After updating TypeORM, ensure that you are using the correct import statement for the `InsertQueryBuilder` class, as shown in the previous section.

## Working with the InsertQueryBuilder Class

Now that you know how to resolve the "InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor" error, let's explore how to work with the `InsertQueryBuilder` class effectively.

First, import the necessary modules from TypeORM:

```javascript
import { createConnection, Connection, InsertQueryBuilder } from 'typeorm';
```

Next, create a connection to your database using the `createConnection` function and then use the `InsertQueryBuilder` class to construct an insert query. In the following example, we will insert a new user into the `users` table:

```javascript
createConnection().then(async (connection: Connection) => {
  const queryBuilder = new InsertQueryBuilder(connection);

  const insertResult = await queryBuilder
    .insert()
    .into('users')
    .values([{ name: 'John Doe', age: 30 }])
    .execute();

  console.log('Insert result:', insertResult);
});
```

In the code above, we first create a connection to the database using the `createConnection` function. Then, we create a new instance of the `InsertQueryBuilder` class, passing the connection as an argument.

We then use the `insert` method to start building our insert query, followed by the `into` method to specify the target table. The `values` method is used to provide the data we want to insert, and finally, we call the `execute` method to execute the query.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have explored the common mistakes that can lead to the "InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor" error in TypeORM and how to resolve them. By ensuring that you import the `InsertQueryBuilder` class correctly and use the latest version of TypeORM, you can avoid this error and work effectively with the `InsertQueryBuilder` class to construct and execute complex insert queries.

The first thing you need to understand is what the error message is trying to tell you. In this case, the message indicates that there is an issue with the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class, specifically that it is not being recognized as a constructor. This means that when you're trying to create a new instance of this class, JavaScript or TypeScript is unable to do so because it doesn't recognize the class as a valid constructor.

To resolve this issue, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the root cause of the error**
2. **Ensure proper import and usage of InsertQueryBuilder**
3. **Check for any conflicts with other libraries or packages**
4. **Update TypeORM to the latest version**
5. **Verify your TypeScript configuration**

Let's go through each step in detail.

### Step 1: Identify the root cause of the error

In order to fix the error, we first need to understand what's causing it. The most common reason for the "InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor" error is that the `InsertQueryBuilder` class is not being imported correctly or is being used in an incorrect manner. 

### Step 2: Ensure proper import and usage of InsertQueryBuilder

To import the `InsertQueryBuilder` class correctly, you should use the following syntax:

```typescript
import { InsertQueryBuilder } from "typeorm";
```

Once you have imported the class, you can create a new instance of it using the `createQueryBuilder` method. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { getConnection } from "typeorm";
import { User } from "./entity/User";

const user = new User();
user.firstName = "John";
user.lastName = "Doe";
user.age = 30;

const queryBuilder = getConnection()
  .createQueryBuilder()
  .insert()
  .into(User)
  .values([user]);

await queryBuilder.execute();
```

In this example, we first import the necessary classes and functions from TypeORM. Then, we create a new `User` instance and set its properties. Next, we create a new `InsertQueryBuilder` instance by calling the `createQueryBuilder` method on the connection object, followed by the `insert` and `into` methods. Finally, we call the `execute` method to run the query.

### Step 3: Check for any conflicts with other libraries or packages

Sometimes, the "InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor" error can be caused by conflicts with other libraries or packages. To resolve this issue, you should check your project's dependencies and ensure that there are no conflicts between TypeORM and other packages. If you find any conflicts, you might need to update or remove the conflicting packages.

### Step 4: Update TypeORM to the latest version

It's possible that the error you're encountering is due to a bug or issue in the version of TypeORM you're using. To resolve this, you should update TypeORM to the latest version by running the following command:

```bash
npm install typeorm@latest
```

After updating, make sure to test your application to ensure that the error has been resolved.

### Step 5: Verify your TypeScript configuration

Lastly, the "InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor" error might be caused by an incorrect TypeScript configuration. To fix this, you should verify your `tsconfig.json` file and ensure that it is configured correctly for use with TypeORM. Here's a sample `tsconfig.json` configuration that works well with TypeORM:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["es6", "dom"],
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

Make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file includes the necessary options, such as `experimentalDecorators` and `emitDecoratorMetadata`, which are required for TypeORM to work properly.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor" error in TypeORM. Remember to always ensure proper import and usage of the `InsertQueryBuilder` class, check for conflicts with other libraries or packages, update TypeORM to the latest version, and verify your TypeScript configuration.

We hope that this detailed guide has helped you understand and resolve the "InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor" error in TypeORM. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the TypeORM community or consult the official documentation. Good luck, and happy coding!
