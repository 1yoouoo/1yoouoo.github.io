Typescript monorepos with common libraries are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to provide a single code base for multiple applications. However, when it comes to production builds, there are a few common mistakes that developers can make, which can lead to unexpected errors. This article will discuss the common mistakes that can be made while handling production builds of a typescript monorepo with common libraries (NestJS), and provide solutions to help developers avoid these errors.

## Common Mistakes

One of the most common mistakes made when handling production builds of a typescript monorepo with common libraries (NestJS) is not properly configuring the build process. NestJS uses webpack for its build process, and it is important to ensure that all of the necessary configurations are in place for the build to run correctly. This includes setting up the webpack configuration file, defining the entry points for each application, and configuring the output directory. If these steps are not taken, the build process can fail, resulting in unexpected errors.

Another common mistake is not properly configuring the type definitions for the libraries. NestJS uses TypeScript for its type definitions, and it is important to ensure that all of the necessary type definitions are in place for the build to run correctly. This includes setting up the type definitions for the libraries, defining the interfaces for each application, and configuring the type definitions for the output directory. If these steps are not taken, the build process can fail, resulting in unexpected errors.

## Configuring the Build Process

The first step in properly configuring the build process for a typescript monorepo with common libraries (NestJS) is to set up the webpack configuration file. The webpack configuration file is used to define the entry points for each application, as well as the output directory. It is important to ensure that all of the necessary configurations are in place for the build to run correctly.

For example, the following webpack configuration file can be used to define the entry points and output directory for a typescript monorepo with common libraries:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    app1: './src/app1/index.ts',
    app2: './src/app2/index.ts',
    app3: './src/app3/index.ts',
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

In this example, the webpack configuration file is used to define the entry points for each application (app1, app2, and app3) and the output directory (dist). This ensures that the build process will correctly compile each application and output the compiled files to the correct directory.

## Configuring Type Definitions

Once the webpack configuration file is set up, it is important to ensure that all of the necessary type definitions are in place for the build to run correctly. NestJS uses TypeScript for its type definitions, and it is important to ensure that all of the necessary type definitions are in place for the build to run correctly.

For example, the following type definitions can be used to define the interfaces for each application:

```typescript
interface App1 {
  name: string;
  version: string;
}

interface App2 {
  name: string;
  version: string;
}

interface App3 {
  name: string;
  version: string;
}
```

In this example, the type definitions are used to define the interfaces for each application (app1, app2, and app3). This ensures that the build process will correctly compile each application and output the compiled files to the correct directory.

## Conclusion

Handling production builds of a typescript monorepo with common libraries (NestJS) can be a challenging task, but with the right configurations and type definitions in place, developers can avoid unexpected errors. It is important to ensure that all of the necessary configurations are in place for the build to run correctly, including setting up the webpack configuration file, defining the entry points for each application, and configuring the output directory. Additionally, it is important to ensure that all of the necessary type definitions are in place for the build to run correctly, including setting up the type definitions for the libraries, defining the interfaces for each application, and configuring the type definitions for the output directory. By taking these steps, developers can ensure that their production builds of a typescript monorepo with common libraries (NestJS) will run correctly.

Building a production-ready monorepo with shared libraries can be a daunting task. It requires a lot of planning, testing, and debugging to ensure that everything works as expected. And when it comes to building a Typescript monorepo with common libraries, there are a few extra steps that need to be taken to ensure that the build is successful. This post will outline the steps necessary to build a production-ready monorepo with common libraries, using NestJS as an example.

## Step 1: Setup a Monorepo

The first step in building a production-ready monorepo with shared libraries is to setup a monorepo. This involves creating a single repository that contains all of the code for the project and all of its dependencies. This can be done by using a version control system like Git or by using a package manager like NPM.

## Step 2: Install NestJS

Once the monorepo has been setup, the next step is to install NestJS. NestJS is a powerful framework for building applications with TypeScript and Node.js. It provides a wide range of features and tools that make it easy to build and deploy applications.

To install NestJS, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install @nestjs/cli
```

## Step 3: Create a NestJS App

Once NestJS has been installed, the next step is to create a NestJS app. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
nest new <project-name>
```

This will create a new NestJS project inside the monorepo.

## Step 4: Add Common Libraries

The next step is to add common libraries to the project. Common libraries are reusable components that can be shared between multiple projects. They can be used to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written and to ensure that all projects are using the same code.

To add common libraries to the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
nest add common
```

This will add the common library to the project.

## Step 5: Setup Typescript

The next step is to setup Typescript. Typescript is a powerful language that provides static type-checking and other features that make it easier to write and maintain code. To setup Typescript, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
nest add typescript
```

This will add the necessary configuration files to the project.

## Step 6: Setup the Build

The next step is to setup the build. This involves configuring the build environment and setting up the necessary scripts to compile the code and run the tests. To setup the build, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
nest build
```

This will create the necessary configuration files and scripts to build the project.

## Step 7: Create a Production Build

Once the build has been setup, the next step is to create a production build. This involves running the necessary scripts to compile the code and package it into a single executable file. To create a production build, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
nest build --prod
```

This will compile the code and create a single executable file.

## Step 8: Test the Build

The final step is to test the build. This involves running the necessary tests to ensure that the code is working as expected. To test the build, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
nest test
```

This will run the necessary tests to ensure that the code is working as expected.

## Conclusion

Building a production-ready monorepo with shared libraries can be a daunting task. However, by following the steps outlined in this post, it is possible to build a production-ready monorepo with common libraries, using NestJS as an example. By taking the time to properly setup the monorepo, install NestJS, add common libraries, setup Typescript, setup the build, create a production build, and test the build, it is possible to create a production-ready monorepo with shared libraries.
