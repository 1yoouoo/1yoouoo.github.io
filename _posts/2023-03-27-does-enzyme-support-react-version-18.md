Enzyme is a popular JavaScript testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output. It is often used in combination with Jest, another popular testing framework. But the question remains: Does Enzyme Support React Version 18?

The answer is yes! Enzyme has been updated to support React version 18. It is important to note, however, that Enzyme is not officially supported by React. React is a library, not a framework, and as such, does not provide official support for any third-party libraries.

Enzyme is a library developed by Airbnb, and it is designed to make it easier to test React components. It is a JavaScript testing utility that provides a way to render components and traverse the output. This makes it easier to assert and manipulate the output of React components.

Enzyme is built on top of React's test renderer and it is not a part of React's core. It is an open source project and it is maintained by a team of developers from Airbnb. The team is actively working on improving Enzyme and making sure it is compatible with the latest version of React.

To use Enzyme with React version 18, you will need to install the latest version of Enzyme. The latest version of Enzyme is 3.10.0. You can install it using npm or yarn.

```javascript
// npm
npm install enzyme --save-dev

// yarn
yarn add enzyme --dev
```

Once you have installed the latest version of Enzyme, you can use it to test your React components. You can use Enzyme's shallow renderer to render components and traverse the output.

```javascript
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';

const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />);
```

You can also use Enzyme's mount renderer to mount components and traverse the output.

```javascript
import { mount } from 'enzyme';

const wrapper = mount(<MyComponent />);
```

Enzyme also provides a way to simulate events on React components. You can use the `simulate()` method to simulate events on components.

```javascript
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';

const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />);

wrapper.find('button').simulate('click');
```

Enzyme also provides a way to test React components with asynchronous code. You can use the `async()` method to wait for asynchronous code to finish before continuing with the test.

```javascript
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';

const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />);

await async(() => {
  // do something asynchronous
});
```

These are just some of the features that Enzyme provides. Enzyme is a powerful and useful tool for testing React components and it is compatible with React version 18.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, Enzyme is a powerful and useful tool for testing React components and it is compatible with React version 18. It is an open source project and it is maintained by a team of developers from Airbnb. Enzyme provides a way to render components and traverse the output, simulate events on components, and test React components with asynchronous code.

Enzyme is a popular JavaScript testing library used for React applications, and it has been around since 2013. It is maintained by Airbnb, and it is one of the most popular testing libraries for React.

However, Enzyme does not support React version 18. This is because Enzyme is built on top of the React TestUtils, which is not compatible with React version 18. This means that if you are using React version 18, you will not be able to use Enzyme for testing.

In this blog post, we will discuss why Enzyme does not support React version 18 and what you can do to get around this issue.

## Why Does Enzyme Not Support React Version 18?

The main reason why Enzyme does not support React version 18 is because it is built on top of the React TestUtils, which is not compatible with React version 18. React TestUtils is a library that was released alongside React version 15. It is used to create and manipulate React components in a test environment.

However, React version 18 introduced a new way of creating and manipulating React components called React Hooks. React Hooks are not compatible with React TestUtils, which means that Enzyme cannot be used with React version 18.

## What Can You Do To Get Around This Issue?

If you are using React version 18 and need to use Enzyme for testing, there are a few things you can do.

The first option is to switch to a different testing library. React Testing Library is a popular alternative to Enzyme, and it is compatible with React version 18. It is built on top of React Hooks, so it does not have the same compatibility issues as Enzyme.

The second option is to use a wrapper library. There are a few wrapper libraries available that allow you to use Enzyme with React version 18. These libraries act as a bridge between Enzyme and React Hooks, allowing you to use Enzyme with React version 18.

The third option is to use a polyfill library. Polyfill libraries are libraries that add missing functionality to older versions of a library. There are a few polyfill libraries available that add React TestUtils functionality to React version 18, allowing you to use Enzyme with React version 18.

## Conclusion

Enzyme does not support React version 18 because it is built on top of the React TestUtils, which is not compatible with React version 18. If you are using React version 18 and need to use Enzyme for testing, you can switch to a different testing library, use a wrapper library, or use a polyfill library.
