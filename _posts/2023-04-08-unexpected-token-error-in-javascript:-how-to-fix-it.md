When writing code in JavaScript, you may encounter an error that reads “Unexpected token”. This error usually occurs when there is a syntax error in the code, such as an unexpected character, keyword, or punctuation. In this article, we will discuss what this error means and how to fix it.

## What is an Unexpected Token Error?

An unexpected token error occurs when the JavaScript interpreter finds something in the code that it does not expect. This could be a keyword, punctuation, or character that is not valid in the context of the code. For example, if you try to use a keyword in an expression, the interpreter will throw an unexpected token error.

## Common Mistakes that Lead to Unexpected Token Errors

There are a few common mistakes that can lead to unexpected token errors in JavaScript.

### Missing Commas

One of the most common mistakes is forgetting to include a comma between two statements. For example, if you forget to add a comma after a variable declaration, the interpreter will throw an unexpected token error.

```javascript
let a = 10
let b = 20
```

In this example, the interpreter will throw an unexpected token error because there is no comma between the two variable declarations.

### Missing Parentheses

Another common mistake is forgetting to include parentheses when defining a function. For example, if you forget to add the parentheses when defining a function, the interpreter will throw an unexpected token error.

```javascript
function add(a, b)
  return a + b
```

In this example, the interpreter will throw an unexpected token error because there are no parentheses after the function definition.

### Unclosed Strings

Another common mistake is forgetting to close a string. For example, if you forget to close a string with a quotation mark, the interpreter will throw an unexpected token error.

```javascript
let str = "Hello
```

In this example, the interpreter will throw an unexpected token error because the string is not closed with a quotation mark.

## How to Fix Unexpected Token Errors

Fixing unexpected token errors in JavaScript is relatively straightforward. The first step is to identify the source of the error. Once you have identified the source of the error, you can then address it by correcting the syntax.

### Step 1: Identify the Source of the Error

The first step in fixing unexpected token errors is to identify the source of the error. To do this, you can look at the line of code that is throwing the error and look for any syntax errors.

For example, if you are getting an unexpected token error on a line of code that includes a function definition, you can check to make sure that the function has the correct syntax, such as the correct number of parentheses and the correct number of parameters.

### Step 2: Correct the Syntax

Once you have identified the source of the error, you can then address it by correcting the syntax. For example, if you are getting an unexpected token error on a line of code that includes a function definition, you can add the missing parentheses or parameters.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

In this example, the function definition now has the correct syntax, so the interpreter will no longer throw an unexpected token error.

## Conclusion

Unexpected token errors in JavaScript are relatively common and can be caused by a variety of syntax errors. The key to fixing these errors is to identify the source of the error and then address it by correcting the syntax. With a little practice, you will be able to quickly identify and fix unexpected token errors in your code.

If you're a JavaScript developer, you're likely to have encountered the dreaded **Unexpected Token Error** at some point. It's one of the most common errors in JavaScript and can be incredibly frustrating to debug and fix. But don't worry, we're here to help! In this post, we'll cover what the Unexpected Token Error is, why it occurs, and how to fix it.

## What is the Unexpected Token Error?

The Unexpected Token Error is a common syntax error that appears when the JavaScript interpreter encounters unexpected tokens in the code. Tokens are the individual elements that make up a program's syntax, such as keywords, operators, and punctuation. When the interpreter encounters an unexpected token, it throws an error.

## Why Does the Unexpected Token Error Occur?

The Unexpected Token Error can occur for a variety of reasons. Some of the most common causes are:

- Incorrectly placed or missing parentheses, brackets, or braces
- Incorrectly placed or missing commas
- Incorrectly placed or missing semicolons
- Incorrectly placed or missing quotes
- Incorrectly placed or missing colons
- Incorrectly placed or missing periods
- Incorrectly placed or missing backslashes

## How to Fix the Unexpected Token Error

The best way to fix the Unexpected Token Error is to locate the unexpected token and correct it. Let's take a look at an example.

Say we have the following code:

```javascript
let x = 5
let y = 10

if (x > y)
  console.log('x is greater than y')
```

If we try to run this code, we get the following error:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'if'
```

This is because the `if` statement is missing a closing curly brace. To fix this, we simply need to add the missing brace:

```javascript
let x = 5
let y = 10

if (x > y) {
  console.log('x is greater than y')
}
```

Now the code runs without any errors.

### Other Tips for Fixing the Unexpected Token Error

- Check for any extra or missing punctuation
- Check for any extra or missing quotes
- Check for any extra or missing backslashes
- Check for any extra or missing parentheses, brackets, or braces
- Check for any extra or missing commas
- Check for any extra or missing semicolons
- Check for any extra or missing colons
- Check for any extra or missing periods
- Check for any typos in your code

## Conclusion

The Unexpected Token Error is a common syntax error in JavaScript that can be frustrating to debug and fix. Fortunately, it's usually easy to locate and correct the unexpected token. All you need to do is check for any extra or missing punctuation, quotes, backslashes, parentheses, brackets, braces, commas, semicolons, colons, and periods, as well as any typos in your code. Once you've corrected the unexpected token, your code should run without any errors.
