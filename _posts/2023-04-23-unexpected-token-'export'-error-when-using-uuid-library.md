When working with the uuid library, a common error developers run into is the **Unexpected Token 'export'** error. This error is thrown when the uuid library is imported into a project, and it can be difficult to identify the source of the problem. In this article, we'll discuss what causes this error, and how to fix it.

## What Causes the Unexpected Token 'export' Error?
The Unexpected Token 'export' error is caused by the way the uuid library is imported into a project. When using the uuid library, it must be imported using the **ES6 import syntax**. This means that the library must be imported using the following syntax:

```javascript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
```

If the library is imported using the **CommonJS require syntax**, the Unexpected Token 'export' error will be thrown. The CommonJS require syntax looks like this:

```javascript
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');
```

## How to Fix the Unexpected Token 'export' Error
The fix for the Unexpected Token 'export' error is simple: make sure to always use the ES6 import syntax when importing the uuid library. If the CommonJS require syntax is used, the Unexpected Token 'export' error will be thrown.

Once the ES6 import syntax is used, the Unexpected Token 'export' error should no longer be thrown and the library should be imported correctly.

## Common Mistakes
When working with the uuid library, there are a few common mistakes that can lead to the Unexpected Token 'export' error being thrown.

The first mistake is forgetting to use the ES6 import syntax. As mentioned above, the uuid library must be imported using the ES6 import syntax, not the CommonJS require syntax.

Another common mistake is forgetting to include the **v4** parameter when importing the library. The v4 parameter is required for the library to work correctly, and if it is not included the Unexpected Token 'export' error will be thrown.

## Conclusion
When working with the uuid library, the Unexpected Token 'export' error can be a difficult problem to solve. The source of the problem is usually the way the library is imported, and it is important to make sure the ES6 import syntax is used. Additionally, it is important to remember to include the v4 parameter when importing the library. By following these steps, the Unexpected Token 'export' error should no longer be thrown.

If you are a developer using the uuid library, you may have come across the following error: **Unexpected token 'export'**. This error can be very frustrating, as it can be difficult to figure out what is causing it and how to fix it. In this article, we will discuss what this error is, why it is happening, and how to fix it.

## What is the Unexpected Token 'export' Error?

The Unexpected Token 'export' error is a syntax error that occurs when the uuid library is used in a project. This error occurs because the uuid library uses the 'export' keyword, which is not supported in certain versions of JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Why Does the Unexpected Token 'export' Error Occur?

The Unexpected Token 'export' error occurs because the uuid library uses the 'export' keyword, which is not supported in certain versions of JavaScript and TypeScript. The 'export' keyword is used to export functions and variables from a module, and is only supported in the latest versions of JavaScript and TypeScript.

## How to Fix the Unexpected Token 'export' Error

The easiest way to fix the Unexpected Token 'export' error is to upgrade to the latest version of JavaScript or TypeScript. If this is not an option, there are a few other solutions that can help.

### Option 1: Use the uuid-es5 Library

The uuid-es5 library is a version of the uuid library that is compatible with older versions of JavaScript and TypeScript. To use the uuid-es5 library, simply install it in your project using the following command:

```
npm install uuid-es5
```

Once the library is installed, you can use it in your project by importing it at the top of your file:

```javascript
import uuid from 'uuid-es5';
```

### Option 2: Use the uuid-lite Library

The uuid-lite library is another version of the uuid library that is compatible with older versions of JavaScript and TypeScript. To use the uuid-lite library, simply install it in your project using the following command:

```
npm install uuid-lite
```

Once the library is installed, you can use it in your project by importing it at the top of your file:

```javascript
import uuid from 'uuid-lite';
```

### Option 3: Use a Polyfill

If you are unable to upgrade to the latest version of JavaScript or TypeScript, you can use a polyfill to add support for the 'export' keyword. To use a polyfill, simply install it in your project using the following command:

```
npm install @babel/polyfill
```

Once the polyfill is installed, you can use it in your project by importing it at the top of your file:

```javascript
import '@babel/polyfill';
```

## Conclusion

The Unexpected Token 'export' error can be a frustrating issue to deal with, but it is possible to fix it. The easiest way to fix the error is to upgrade to the latest version of JavaScript or TypeScript. If this is not an option, you can use the uuid-es5 or uuid-lite libraries, or use a polyfill to add support for the 'export' keyword. With these solutions, you should be able to get your project up and running in no time.
