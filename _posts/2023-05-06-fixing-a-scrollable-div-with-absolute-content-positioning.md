A scrollable div is a great way to display content on a website without taking up too much space. However, when using absolute content positioning, it can be difficult to get the div to scroll properly. This article will explain how to fix a scrollable div with absolute content positioning in order to ensure that the content is displayed correctly.

## Common Mistakes

When dealing with a scrollable div with absolute content positioning, there are a few common mistakes that can be made. The most common mistake is not setting the `overflow` property correctly. The `overflow` property should be set to `scroll` in order for the div to be scrollable. Additionally, it is important to make sure that the `position` property is set to `absolute`. If it is set to `relative` or `fixed`, the div will not be scrollable.

Another common mistake is not setting the `height` and `width` properties of the div correctly. In order for the div to be scrollable, it must have a set `height` and `width`. If these properties are not set correctly, the div will not be scrollable.

## Javascript Code

In order to ensure that the div is scrollable, the following code should be added to the div:

```javascript
<div style="overflow: scroll; position: absolute; height: 300px; width: 500px;">
  // Content goes here
</div>
```

The `overflow` property should be set to `scroll` in order for the div to be scrollable. Additionally, the `position` property should be set to `absolute` in order for the div to be positioned correctly. The `height` and `width` properties should also be set in order for the div to be scrollable.

## CSS Code

In addition to the Javascript code, the following CSS code should also be added to the div:

```css
div {
  overflow-x: hidden;
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

The `overflow-x` property should be set to `hidden` in order to prevent the content from overflowing horizontally. The `overflow-y` property should be set to `auto` in order for the div to be scrollable.

## Conclusion

Fixing a scrollable div with absolute content positioning can be a tricky process, but with the right code and settings, it can be done. By setting the `overflow`, `position`, `height`, and `width` properties correctly, as well as adding the appropriate Javascript and CSS code, the div can be made scrollable.

When trying to create a scrollable div with absolute content positioning, you may run into an issue where the content within the div is not being positioned properly. This can be a very frustrating problem to troubleshoot, but luckily it can be easily solved with a few simple steps.

## Step 1: Set the Div's Position to Relative

The first step to fixing this issue is to set the div's position to relative. This can be done by adding the following CSS code to your stylesheet:

```css
.scrollable-div {
   position: relative;
}
```

By setting the div's position to relative, you are allowing the content within the div to be positioned absolutely relative to the div itself.

## Step 2: Add the Overflow Property

The next step is to add the overflow property to the div. This can be done by adding the following CSS code to your stylesheet:

```css
.scrollable-div {
   position: relative;
   overflow: auto;
}
```

By adding the overflow property, you are allowing the content within the div to be scrollable.

## Step 3: Add the Position Property to the Content

The last step is to add the position property to the content within the div. This can be done by adding the following CSS code to your stylesheet:

```css
.scrollable-div .content {
   position: absolute;
}
```

By adding the position property to the content, you are allowing the content to be positioned absolutely relative to the div itself.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should now have a div with scrollable content that is properly positioned. If you are still having trouble getting the div to work correctly, you may want to try some of the other solutions available online. Good luck!
