GraphQL is a powerful query language that allows developers to retrieve data from a server in a more efficient and organized manner. It is widely used by developers to build complex and powerful applications. One of the most popular GraphQL frameworks is NestJS, which is an open-source framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications.

NestJS provides a powerful and flexible way of defining GraphQL schemas and resolvers. The most commonly used resolver is the `ResolveField` resolver, which is used to define the fields of a GraphQL type. However, NestJS also provides the ability to use guards with `ResolveField` to ensure that only authorized users can access certain fields. In this article, we will look at how to use guards with `ResolveField` in NestJS GraphQL.

## What are Guards?

Guards are functions that are used to check whether a user is authorized to access a certain field or not. If the guard returns `true`, the user is allowed to access the field. Otherwise, the user is not allowed to access the field. 

Guards are useful in GraphQL applications because they allow developers to control who can access certain fields. For example, if a user is not authorized to view a certain field, the guard can prevent the user from accessing the field. This helps to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.

## Using Guards with ResolveField

In NestJS, guards can be used with the `ResolveField` resolver to control who can access certain fields. To use a guard with `ResolveField`, the guard must first be registered in the `@Module()` decorator. For example, if we have a guard called `AuthGuard`, we can register it in the `@Module()` decorator as follows:

```typescript
@Module({
  providers: [AuthGuard],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Once the guard is registered, it can be used with the `@UseGuards()` decorator. The `@UseGuards()` decorator takes an array of guards as its argument. For example, if we wanted to use the `AuthGuard` with the `ResolveField` resolver, we could do the following:

```typescript
@ResolveField()
@UseGuards(AuthGuard)
public async getUser(@Parent() parent: any): Promise<User> {
  // Get user data
}
```

In this example, we are using the `AuthGuard` to ensure that only authorized users can access the `getUser()` resolver. If the guard returns `true`, the user will be allowed to access the resolver. Otherwise, the user will not be allowed to access the resolver.

## Common Mistakes

Using guards with `ResolveField` in NestJS GraphQL can be tricky, and there are a few common mistakes that developers make when using them.

One common mistake is forgetting to register the guard in the `@Module()` decorator. If the guard is not registered, it will not be available to use with the `@UseGuards()` decorator.

Another common mistake is not passing the correct arguments to the `@UseGuards()` decorator. The `@UseGuards()` decorator takes an array of guards as its argument, so it is important to make sure that the correct guards are being passed in.

Finally, it is important to remember that guards are only applied to the resolver functions, not the fields. If a guard is used with a field, it will not be applied.

## Conclusion

Using guards with `ResolveField` in NestJS GraphQL is a powerful way to control who can access certain fields. By registering the guards in the `@Module()` decorator and using the `@UseGuards()` decorator, developers can ensure that only authorized users can access certain fields. However, it is important to remember to register the guards in the `@Module()` decorator and to pass the correct arguments to the `@UseGuards()` decorator, as these are common mistakes that developers make when using guards with `ResolveField`.

GraphQL is a powerful query language that can be used to query and mutate data in an API. It is often used to build modern web and mobile applications. NestJS is a popular Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable server-side applications. It uses the GraphQL library to provide a powerful way to query and mutate data.

When using NestJS with GraphQL, it is possible to use guards to protect certain fields from being queried or mutated. In this blog post, we will explore how to use guards with the ResolveField method in NestJS to protect certain fields from being queried or mutated.

## What are Guards?

Guards in NestJS are functions that are used to protect certain routes or fields from being accessed. They can be used to check if a user is authenticated before allowing them to access a route or field. They can also be used to check if a user has the correct permissions to access a route or field.

## What is ResolveField?

ResolveField is a method in NestJS that is used to resolve a field in a GraphQL query. It takes two parameters: the root object and the arguments passed in the query.

## Using Guards with ResolveField

In order to use guards with ResolveField, we need to create a guard function that checks if a user is authenticated and has the correct permissions. We can then use this guard function in the ResolveField method to protect certain fields from being queried or mutated.

Let's look at an example. We have a GraphQL query that looks like this:

```
query {
  user {
    name
    age
    address
  }
}
```

We want to protect the `address` field from being queried or mutated unless the user is authenticated and has the correct permissions. To do this, we need to create a guard function that checks if the user is authenticated and has the correct permissions. Let's call this function `isAuthenticated`.

The `isAuthenticated` function will check if the user is authenticated and has the correct permissions. If the user is authenticated and has the correct permissions, the function will return `true`. If the user is not authenticated or does not have the correct permissions, the function will return `false`.

Now that we have our guard function, we can use it in the ResolveField method to protect the `address` field from being queried or mutated. The ResolveField method takes two parameters: the root object and the arguments passed in the query.

The root object is the object that contains the data that is being queried or mutated. In this case, the root object is the `user` object. The arguments passed in the query are the fields that are being queried or mutated. In this case, the arguments are `name`, `age`, and `address`.

We can use the `isAuthenticated` function in the ResolveField method to protect the `address` field from being queried or mutated. The code for the ResolveField method will look like this:

```
@ResolveField(() => String, { nullable: true })
async address(@Root() user: User, @Args() args: any): Promise<string | null> {
  if (isAuthenticated(user, args.address)) {
    return user.address;
  }
  return null;
}
```

The `isAuthenticated` function is called with the `user` object and the `address` argument. If the user is authenticated and has the correct permissions, the `address` field will be returned. If the user is not authenticated or does not have the correct permissions, `null` will be returned.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to use guards with the ResolveField method in NestJS to protect certain fields from being queried or mutated. We created a guard function that checks if a user is authenticated and has the correct permissions. We then used this guard function in the ResolveField method to protect the `address` field from being queried or mutated.

Using guards with ResolveField is a powerful way to protect certain fields from being queried or mutated. It is a great way to ensure that only authenticated users with the correct permissions can access certain fields in a GraphQL query.
