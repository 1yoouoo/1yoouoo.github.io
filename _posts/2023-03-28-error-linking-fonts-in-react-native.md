When working with React Native, you may encounter an error when attempting to link fonts. This error is often caused by a few common mistakes, which can be easily resolved. In this article, we will discuss what these errors are, how to fix them, and how to avoid them in the future.

## What is the Error?

The error usually looks something like this:

```
error: bundling failed: Error: Unable to resolve module `./assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf` from `node_modules\react-native\Libraries\Text\Text.js`: The module `./assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf` could not be found from the root of the package
```

This error occurs when React Native is unable to find the font file specified in the `Text` component. The error usually occurs when the font is not linked correctly.

## Common Mistakes

There are two common mistakes that can lead to this error. The first is that the font file is not located in the `assets/fonts` folder. React Native looks for font files in this folder by default. If the font file is not located in this folder, the error will occur.

The second mistake is that the font file is not linked correctly in the `Text` component. To link a font file correctly, you must include the full path of the font file in the `style` property of the `Text` component. For example, if the font file is located in `assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf`, you would include the following in the `style` property:

```
style={{ fontFamily: 'Roboto-Regular.ttf' }}
```

Including this in the `style` property will ensure that the font file is linked correctly and the error will not occur.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, linking fonts in React Native can be a tricky process. However, by ensuring that the font file is located in the `assets/fonts` folder and that the full path of the font file is included in the `style` property of the `Text` component, you can avoid this error.

React Native is a powerful framework that allows developers to create mobile applications with JavaScript. One of the most common issues developers run into when creating React Native applications is linking fonts. This can be a tricky process, as there are many different ways to link fonts and the process can be different depending on the font file type.

In this blog post, we will go over the process of linking fonts in React Native. We will also cover some of the most common errors that can occur when linking fonts and how to fix them.

## Step 1: Install the React Native Vector Icons Package

The first step to linking fonts in React Native is to install the React Native Vector Icons package. This package provides a set of customizable icons that you can use in your React Native application. To install the package, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install --save react-native-vector-icons
```

## Step 2: Link the Package

Once the package is installed, you will need to link it to your project. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```
react-native link react-native-vector-icons
```

This will link the package to your project and allow you to use the icons in your application.

## Step 3: Add the Fonts to Your Project

The next step is to add the fonts to your project. Depending on the type of font you are using, you may need to add the font files to your project manually. For example, if you are using a TrueType font (.ttf) file, you will need to add the font file to your project manually.

To do this, simply add the font file to your project's `assets/fonts` folder. Once the font file is in the folder, you can link it to your project by adding the following line of code to your project's `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```
apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle"
```

## Step 4: Link the Fonts in Your App

The final step is to link the fonts in your app. To do this, add the following line of code to your project's `index.js` file:

```
import { Font } from 'expo';
```

Then, add the following code to your project's `App.js` file:

```
async componentDidMount() {
  await Font.loadAsync({
    'font-name': require('./assets/fonts/font-name.ttf'),
  });
}
```

Replace `font-name` with the name of the font file you added to your project.

## Common Errors

When linking fonts in React Native, there are a few common errors that you may run into. Let's take a look at some of the most common errors and how to fix them.

### Error: Unable to Resolve Module

If you get an error that says "Unable to resolve module" when linking fonts, it means that the font file you are trying to link is not in the correct location. Make sure that the font file is in the `assets/fonts` folder and that it is named correctly.

### Error: Font Not Found

If you get an error that says "Font not found", it means that the font file you are trying to link is not in the correct format. Make sure that the font file is a TrueType font (.ttf) file and that it is named correctly.

### Error: Font Not Linked

If you get an error that says "Font not linked", it means that the font file is in the correct location and format, but it is not linked to your project. Make sure that you have added the following line of code to your project's `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```
apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle"
```

## Conclusion

Linking fonts in React Native can be a tricky process, but with the right steps, it can be done with ease. In this blog post, we have gone over the process of linking fonts in React Native and some of the most common errors that can occur when linking fonts. We hope that this blog post has been helpful and that you are now able to link fonts in your React Native application with ease.
