Google Place Autocomplete is a powerful API that allows developers to easily add an autocomplete search box to their web applications. It provides users with a list of suggested locations as they type, making it easier for them to quickly find the address they are looking for. However, there are some common errors that can occur when using this API. In this article, we will discuss how to fix one of these errors, the "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of null" error, using the addEventListener() method.

## What is the addEventListener() Method?

The addEventListener() method is a JavaScript method that allows you to add an event listener to an element. An event listener is a function that will be called when a specified event occurs. This can be used to execute code when a certain event occurs, such as when a user clicks on a button or when a page loads.

## Why is the addEventListener() Method Used to Fix the Google Place Autocomplete Error?

The "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of null" error is caused by a missing or incorrect reference to the Google Maps API. This error can occur when the Google Maps API is not included on the page, or when the reference to the API is incorrect.

In order to fix this error, the addEventListener() method can be used to add an event listener to the Google Maps API script. This will ensure that the API is loaded correctly and that the error is no longer triggered.

## How to Use the addEventListener() Method to Fix the Google Place Autocomplete Error

The following code shows how to use the addEventListener() method to fix the "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of null" error.

```javascript
// Create a new script element
let script = document.createElement('script');

// Set the source of the script to the Google Maps API
script.src = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places';

// Add an event listener to the script
script.addEventListener('load', () => {
    // Code to execute when the script has loaded
});

// Append the script to the document
document.body.appendChild(script);
```

In this code, we first create a new script element. We then set the source of the script to the Google Maps API. We then add an event listener to the script that will be called when the script has loaded. Finally, we append the script to the document. This will ensure that the Google Maps API is correctly loaded and that the error is no longer triggered.

autocomplete.addListener('place_changed', function() {
    // Do something
});
```
