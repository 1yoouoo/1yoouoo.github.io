NestJS-Swagger is a powerful tool for creating RESTful APIs with NestJS. It allows developers to quickly and easily create APIs with minimal coding effort. However, when using NestJS-Swagger, developers may encounter errors when trying to create their APIs. One such error is the need to write `@ApiProperty()` in each DTO (Data Transfer Object) for NestJS-Swagger. In this article, we will discuss how to avoid this error and create a successful API with NestJS-Swagger.

## What is NestJS-Swagger?

NestJS-Swagger is a library for creating RESTful APIs with NestJS. It is a powerful tool that allows developers to quickly and easily create APIs with minimal coding effort. NestJS-Swagger provides a set of tools for creating RESTful APIs with NestJS, including a code generator, a swagger editor, and a swagger UI. It also provides an API for creating and managing data transfer objects (DTOs).

## Why Do I Need to Write @ApiProperty() in Each DTO for NestJS-Swagger?

When creating an API with NestJS-Swagger, developers must write `@ApiProperty()` in each DTO. This is because NestJS-Swagger uses the `@ApiProperty()` annotation to define the properties of a DTO. The `@ApiProperty()` annotation is used to define the type, name, and description of each property in the DTO. Without this annotation, NestJS-Swagger will not be able to generate the API correctly.

## Common Mistakes When Writing @ApiProperty()

When writing `@ApiProperty()`, developers often make two common mistakes. The first mistake is forgetting to add the `@ApiProperty()` annotation to each DTO. Without this annotation, NestJS-Swagger will not be able to generate the API correctly. The second mistake is not including all of the required properties in the `@ApiProperty()` annotation. The `@ApiProperty()` annotation requires a type, name, and description for each property in the DTO. If any of these are missing, NestJS-Swagger will not be able to generate the API correctly.

## How to Avoid Writing @ApiProperty() in Each DTO for NestJS-Swagger

The best way to avoid writing `@ApiProperty()` in each DTO for NestJS-Swagger is to use the NestJS-Swagger code generator. The code generator is a tool that automatically generates the `@ApiProperty()` annotations for each DTO. It allows developers to quickly and easily create APIs with minimal coding effort.

To use the code generator, developers must first create a new project in NestJS-Swagger. Once the project is created, developers can select the “Generate Code” option from the menu. This will open the code generator, which will automatically generate the `@ApiProperty()` annotations for each DTO.

## Example

For example, the following code shows a DTO without the `@ApiProperty()` annotation:

```typescript
export class UserDTO {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
}
```

When using the NestJS-Swagger code generator, the code will be automatically updated to include the `@ApiProperty()` annotation for each property in the DTO:

```typescript
export class UserDTO {
  @ApiProperty({ type: String })
  name: string;

  @ApiProperty({ type: String })
  email: string;

  @ApiProperty({ type: Number })
  age: number;
}
```

By using the code generator, developers can easily avoid writing `@ApiProperty()` in each DTO for NestJS-Swagger.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, NestJS-Swagger is a powerful tool for creating RESTful APIs with NestJS. However, when using NestJS-Swagger, developers may encounter errors when trying to create their APIs. One such error is the need to write `@ApiProperty()` in each DTO (Data Transfer Object) for NestJS-Swagger. To avoid this error, developers should use the NestJS-Swagger code generator to automatically generate the `@ApiProperty()` annotations for each DTO.

When building a web application with NestJS and Swagger, you may encounter an error that reads "ApiProperty() must be defined for each DTO". This error is caused when the @ApiProperty() decorator is not used to define the properties of the DTO (Data Transfer Object). In this blog post, we'll take a look at how to avoid this error and get your application up and running.

## What is the @ApiProperty() Decorator? 

The @ApiProperty() decorator is a special type of decorator used in NestJS and Swagger to define the properties of a DTO. It is used to provide information about the properties of a DTO, such as its type, whether it is required, and a description. This information is used by Swagger to generate an interactive documentation page for your application. 

## Why Do I Need to Use the @ApiProperty() Decorator?

By using the @ApiProperty() decorator, you can provide Swagger with the information it needs to generate the interactive documentation page. Without this information, Swagger will not be able to generate the page, and this will result in the "ApiProperty() must be defined for each DTO" error. 

## How to Avoid Writing @ApiProperty() in Each DTO

To avoid writing @ApiProperty() in each DTO, you can use the `@ApiHideProperty()` decorator. This decorator will hide the property from the Swagger documentation page, but still allow the property to be used in your application.

To use the `@ApiHideProperty()` decorator, you simply need to add it to the property you want to hide. For example, if you had a DTO with a property called `name`, you could hide it from the Swagger documentation page by using the following code: 

```typescript
@ApiHideProperty()
name: string;
```

## Summary

In this blog post, we looked at how to avoid writing @ApiProperty() in each DTO for NestJS-Swagger. We discussed what the @ApiProperty() decorator is and why it is necessary. We then looked at how to avoid writing @ApiProperty() in each DTO by using the `@ApiHideProperty()` decorator. By using this decorator, you can hide properties from the Swagger documentation page and avoid the "ApiProperty() must be defined for each DTO" error.
