Creating a custom repository with TypeORM and NestJS for MongoDB is a great way to organize and store data in a structured way. However, there are some common mistakes that can be made when creating a custom repository. This article will provide an overview of the process of creating a custom repository with TypeORM and NestJS for MongoDB, as well as some tips and tricks to help you avoid potential errors.

## What is TypeORM?
TypeORM is an open-source object-relational mapper (ORM) for Node.js, written in TypeScript. It supports both the traditional SQL databases, as well as the MongoDB NoSQL database. It is designed to provide a simple and consistent API, allowing developers to easily work with different databases.

## What is NestJS?
NestJS is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses TypeScript, a modern programming language that is a superset of JavaScript, as its language of choice. NestJS provides a powerful modular architecture that makes it easy to create and maintain large-scale applications.

## Creating a Custom Repository
When creating a custom repository with TypeORM and NestJS for MongoDB, there are a few steps that need to be taken. First, you will need to create a MongoDB database and a Mongoose schema. Then, you will need to create a TypeORM repository for the MongoDB database. Finally, you will need to create a NestJS service that will use the TypeORM repository.

### Step 1: Create a MongoDB Database
The first step in creating a custom repository with TypeORM and NestJS for MongoDB is to create a MongoDB database. This can be done using the MongoDB shell, or using a GUI client such as MongoDB Compass. Once the database has been created, you will need to create a Mongoose schema for the database.

### Step 2: Create a Mongoose Schema
A Mongoose schema is a JavaScript object that defines the structure of a MongoDB document. It is used to define the fields and types of data that will be stored in the document. The Mongoose schema can be created using the Mongoose Schema constructor.

```javascript
const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  age: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  gender: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  }
});
```

In the above example, we have defined a Mongoose schema with three fields: name, age, and gender. Each field is defined with a type and a required flag. The type defines the type of data that will be stored in the field, while the required flag indicates whether or not the field is required.

### Step 3: Create a TypeORM Repository
Once the Mongoose schema has been created, the next step is to create a TypeORM repository for the MongoDB database. This can be done using the TypeORM Repository constructor.

```typescript
@EntityRepository(MyEntity)
export class MyEntityRepository extends Repository<MyEntity> {
  // ...
}
```

In the above example, we have created a TypeORM repository for the MongoDB database. The repository is associated with the Mongoose schema that was created in the previous step.

### Step 4: Create a NestJS Service
The final step in creating a custom repository with TypeORM and NestJS for MongoDB is to create a NestJS service that will use the TypeORM repository. This can be done using the NestJS Service decorator.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class MyEntityService {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(MyEntity)
    private readonly myEntityRepository: MyEntityRepository,
  ) {}
 
  async findAll(): Promise<MyEntity[]> {
    return await this.myEntityRepository.find();
  }
}
```

In the above example, we have created a NestJS service that will use the TypeORM repository that was created in the previous step. The service has a method, findAll(), that will return all the documents in the MongoDB database.

## Conclusion
Creating a custom repository with TypeORM and NestJS for MongoDB can be a complicated process, and there are a few common mistakes that can be made. It is important to make sure that all the steps are followed correctly, and that the Mongoose schema, TypeORM repository, and NestJS service are all properly configured. Following these steps will help ensure that your custom repository is properly set up and functioning correctly.

When it comes to creating a custom repository with TypeORM and NestJS for MongoDB, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind. In this blog post, we will go through the steps to create a custom repository with TypeORM and NestJS for MongoDB.

## Setting up the Environment

The first step is to set up the environment. This includes installing the necessary packages and setting up the database.

### Installing Packages

To start, you need to install the necessary packages. The packages you will need are:

- TypeORM
- NestJS
- MongoDB

You can install these packages using npm.

```javascript
npm install typeorm
npm install @nestjs/typeorm
npm install mongodb
```

### Setting up the Database

Once you have installed the necessary packages, you will need to set up the database. For this example, we will use MongoDB.

To set up the database, you will need to create a file called `db.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useCreateIndex: true,
      useFindAndModify: false,
      useUnifiedTopology: true
    });
    console.log('MongoDB Connected...');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err.message);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

module.exports = connectDB;
```

This code will connect to the MongoDB database.

## Creating the Repository

Once the environment is set up, you can create the repository. This involves creating the repository class, the model, and the controller.

### Creating the Repository Class

The first step is to create the repository class. This class will contain the methods used to interact with the database.

To create the repository class, you will need to create a file called `repository.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
import { EntityRepository, Repository } from 'typeorm';

@EntityRepository(User)
export class UserRepository extends Repository<User> {
  async findByEmail(email: string): Promise<User> {
    return this.findOne({ where: { email } });
  }
}
```

This code creates a repository class that contains a method to find a user by their email address.

### Creating the Model

The next step is to create the model. This model will contain the fields for the database.

To create the model, you will need to create a file called `user.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Column()
  email: string;
}
```

This code creates a model with three fields, `id`, `name`, and `email`.

### Creating the Controller

The final step is to create the controller. This controller will contain the methods used to interact with the repository.

To create the controller, you will need to create a file called `user.controller.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Param } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UserRepository } from './repository';

@Controller('user')
export class UserController {
  constructor(private readonly userRepository: UserRepository) {}

  @Get('/:email')
  async findByEmail(@Param('email') email: string): Promise<User> {
    return this.userRepository.findByEmail(email);
  }
}
```

This code creates a controller with one method, `findByEmail`, which will use the repository to find a user by their email address.

## Conclusion

Creating a custom repository with TypeORM and NestJS for MongoDB is a great way to interact with a MongoDB database. In this blog post, we have gone through the steps to create a custom repository with TypeORM and NestJS for MongoDB. We have installed the necessary packages, set up the database, created the repository class, the model, and the controller.

By following these steps, you should now be able to create a custom repository with TypeORM and NestJS for MongoDB.
