NestJS is a popular Node.js web framework for creating efficient and scalable server-side applications. It is built with TypeScript and provides a powerful set of features for creating web applications and APIs. One of the most useful features of NestJS is the ability to use WebSockets for real-time communication between the server and the client.

However, using WebSockets with NestJS can be tricky. In this article, we will explore how to access the client URL and hostname when using WebSockets in NestJS.

## Understanding WebSockets

WebSockets are a protocol for bi-directional, real-time communication between a client and a server. They are a popular choice for web applications that require real-time communication, such as chat applications, multi-player games, and live data streaming.

WebSockets are based on the HTTP protocol, but they provide a persistent connection between the server and the client. This allows the server to push data to the client, and vice versa. This is in contrast to the request-response model of HTTP, where the client must always initiate communication with the server.

## Accessing the Client URL and Hostname

When using WebSockets in NestJS, it is often necessary to access the client's URL and hostname. This can be done by using the `@WebSocketClient` decorator. This decorator takes a single parameter, which is the client's URL and hostname.

The `@WebSocketClient` decorator is used to decorate the class that represents the client. This class must implement the `@WebSocketClient` interface, which is included in the `@nestjs/websockets` package.

Once the class is decorated, the client's URL and hostname can be accessed using the `getUrl()` and `getHostname()` methods. These methods will return the client's URL and hostname, respectively.

## Example

To illustrate how to access the client's URL and hostname in NestJS, let's create a simple chat application. This application will use WebSockets to communicate between the server and the client.

First, let's create the client class. This class must implement the `@WebSocketClient` interface, so it must have the `@WebSocketClient` decorator. This decorator takes a single parameter, which is the client's URL and hostname.

```typescript
@WebSocketClient('ws://localhost:3000')
export class ChatClient implements WebSocketClient {
  // ...
}
```

Next, let's create a method to handle incoming messages from the client. This method will take the client's URL and hostname as parameters.

```typescript
handleMessage(client: ChatClient, url: string, hostname: string) {
  // Handle incoming message
}
```

Finally, let's use the `getUrl()` and `getHostname()` methods to access the client's URL and hostname.

```typescript
handleMessage(client: ChatClient, url: string, hostname: string) {
  const clientUrl = client.getUrl();
  const clientHostname = client.getHostname();

  // Handle incoming message
}
```

In this example, we used the `@WebSocketClient` decorator to decorate the client class. We then used the `getUrl()` and `getHostname()` methods to access the client's URL and hostname.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored how to access the client URL and hostname when using WebSockets in NestJS. We saw how to use the `@WebSocketClient` decorator to decorate the client class, and how to use the `getUrl()` and `getHostname()` methods to access the client's URL and hostname.

When working with web applications, it is often necessary to access the client URL and hostname in order to provide the user with a better experience. In particular, when working with WebSockets, it is often necessary to access the client URL and hostname in order to allow the server to connect with the client. This is especially true when working with the NestJS framework.

In this blog post, we'll discuss how to access the client URL and hostname with WebSockets in NestJS. We'll also provide a step-by-step guide to help developers troubleshoot and resolve any issues they may encounter.

## What is NestJS?

NestJS is a Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and enterprise-grade server-side applications. It is based on TypeScript and provides a powerful set of features for web and mobile applications.

NestJS provides a powerful set of features for web and mobile applications, including WebSockets, which allows for real-time communication between the server and the client. In order to use WebSockets, it is necessary to access the client URL and hostname.

## Accessing the Client URL and Hostname

In order to access the client URL and hostname with WebSockets in NestJS, we need to use the “@nestjs/websockets” package. This package provides a set of decorators and functions that allow us to access the client URL and hostname.

The first step is to install the “@nestjs/websockets” package in our project. We can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```
npm install @nestjs/websockets
```

Once the package is installed, we can access the client URL and hostname by using the “@Client()” decorator. This decorator allows us to access the client URL and hostname from within our controller or service.

The following example shows how to access the client URL and hostname in a controller:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Client } from '@nestjs/websockets';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @Get()
  public async getClientUrlAndHostname(@Client() client) {
    const { url, hostname } = client;
    return { url, hostname };
  }
}
```

The “@Client()” decorator takes a single argument, which is the client object. This object contains the URL and hostname of the client. We can access these values by using the “url” and “hostname” properties.

In the example above, we are using the “@Get()” decorator to create an endpoint that will return the client URL and hostname. This endpoint can then be used to access the client URL and hostname from the client side.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues when trying to access the client URL and hostname with WebSockets in NestJS, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem.

First, make sure that the “@nestjs/websockets” package is installed in your project. If it is not installed, you will need to install it before you can use the “@Client()” decorator.

Second, make sure that you are using the correct decorator when accessing the client URL and hostname. The “@Client()” decorator is used to access the client URL and hostname, not the “@Get()” decorator.

Finally, make sure that you are using the correct syntax when accessing the client URL and hostname. The “@Client()” decorator takes a single argument, which is the client object. This object contains the URL and hostname of the client.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we discussed how to access the client URL and hostname with WebSockets in NestJS. We provided a step-by-step guide to help developers troubleshoot and resolve any issues they may encounter.

We also discussed what NestJS is and how to install the “@nestjs/websockets” package. Finally, we discussed how to use the “@Client()” decorator to access the client URL and hostname.

We hope this blog post was helpful and that it will help you access the client URL and hostname with WebSockets in NestJS. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them in the comments section below.
