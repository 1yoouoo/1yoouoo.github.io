Next.js is a popular React framework that allows developers to create server-rendered React applications. One of the key features of Next.js is the ability to pass data between pages. This allows developers to create complex applications with multiple pages that communicate with each other.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to pass data between pages in Next.js. We'll look at the different ways of passing data and discuss the pros and cons of each approach. We'll also look at how to use the built-in `getInitialProps` method to pass data between pages.

## Passing Data with Query Strings
The simplest way to pass data between pages in Next.js is to use query strings. Query strings are the part of a URL that comes after the `?` character. They are used to pass data from one page to another.

To use query strings, we need to add the data to the URL. We can do this using the `query` object provided by Next.js. For example, if we wanted to pass the name `John` from one page to another, we could do the following:

```js
// Page 1
const page1 = () => {
  const name = 'John';
  return {
    pathname: '/page2',
    query: { name },
  };
};

// Page 2
const page2 = ({ query }) => {
  const { name } = query;
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
};
```

If we navigate to `/page2?name=John`, the `page2` component will render the `Hello John` heading.

The query string approach is simple and easy to use, but it has some drawbacks. First, the data is visible in the URL, which can be a security risk. Second, the data is limited to strings, so it's not suitable for passing more complex data.

## Passing Data with Props
Another way to pass data between pages in Next.js is to use props. Props are a way of passing data from one component to another. They are commonly used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

In Next.js, we can use props to pass data between pages. To do this, we need to use the `Router` component provided by Next.js. The `Router` component takes a `route` prop, which is an object containing the pathname and any props we want to pass.

For example, if we wanted to pass the name `John` from one page to another, we could do the following:

```js
// Page 1
const page1 = () => {
  const name = 'John';
  return (
    <Router
      route={{
        pathname: '/page2',
        props: { name },
      }}
    />
  );
};

// Page 2
const page2 = (props) => {
  const { name } = props;
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
};
```

If we navigate to `/page2`, the `page2` component will render the `Hello John` heading.

The props approach is more secure than the query string approach, as the data is not visible in the URL. It also allows us to pass more complex data, such as objects or arrays.

## Passing Data with getInitialProps
Next.js provides a built-in method called `getInitialProps` that can be used to pass data between pages. `getInitialProps` is a static method that is called before a page is rendered. It takes a single argument, `context`, which contains information about the current request.

We can use `getInitialProps` to pass data from one page to another. To do this, we need to call the `context.query` method to get the query string parameters. We can then use these parameters to set the props for the page.

For example, if we wanted to pass the name `John` from one page to another, we could do the following:

```js
// Page 1
const page1 = () => {
  const name = 'John';
  return {
    pathname: '/page2',
    query: { name },
  };
};

// Page 2
Page2.getInitialProps = async (context) => {
  const { name } = context.query;
  return { name };
};

const page2 = (props) => {
  const { name } = props;
  return <h1>Hello {name}</h1>;
};
```

If we navigate to `/page2?name=John`, the `page2` component will render the `Hello John` heading.

The `getInitialProps` approach is more secure than the query string or props approaches, as the data is not visible in the URL. It also allows us to pass more complex data, such as objects or arrays.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to pass data between pages in Next.js. We've looked at the different ways of passing data and discussed the pros and cons of each approach. We've also looked at how to use the built-in `getInitialProps` method to pass data between pages.

When building a web application in Next.js, it is often necessary to pass data between pages. This can be done in a variety of ways, but the most common method is to use the `query` object. The `query` object is a set of key-value pairs that are passed in the URL. 

The `query` object is available in all routes, including the `getInitialProps` lifecycle method. This allows you to pass data from one page to another. In this article, we will look at how to use the `query` object to pass data between pages in Next.js.

## Accessing the Query Object

The `query` object is available in the `getInitialProps` lifecycle method. The `getInitialProps` method is called before the page is rendered, and it is passed an object containing the `query` object. You can access the `query` object like this:

```js
static async getInitialProps({ query }) {
  // Access the query object here
}
```

## Passing Data Between Pages

Now that we have access to the `query` object, we can use it to pass data between pages. To do this, we need to add the data to the `query` object when the page is first loaded. We can do this by adding the data to the URL when the page is loaded.

For example, let's say we want to pass a user ID from one page to another. We can do this by adding the user ID to the URL when the page is first loaded, like this:

```js
// Page 1
router.push({
  pathname: '/page2',
  query: {
    userId: 123
  }
})
```

Now, when the page is loaded, the `query` object will contain the user ID. We can access it like this:

```js
static async getInitialProps({ query }) {
  const { userId } = query;
  // Do something with the user ID
}
```

## Using the Query Object

Now that we have access to the `query` object, we can use it to pass data between pages. The `query` object is a set of key-value pairs, so we can pass any type of data we want. We can pass strings, numbers, objects, arrays, and more.

For example, let's say we want to pass an array of user IDs from one page to another. We can do this by adding the array to the URL when the page is first loaded, like this:

```js
// Page 1
router.push({
  pathname: '/page2',
  query: {
    userIds: [123, 456, 789]
  }
})
```

Now, when the page is loaded, the `query` object will contain the array of user IDs. We can access it like this:

```js
static async getInitialProps({ query }) {
  const { userIds } = query;
  // Do something with the array of user IDs
}
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we looked at how to pass data between pages in Next.js using the `query` object. The `query` object is a set of key-value pairs that are passed in the URL, and it can be accessed in the `getInitialProps` lifecycle method. We can use the `query` object to pass any type of data we want, including strings, numbers, objects, and arrays.
