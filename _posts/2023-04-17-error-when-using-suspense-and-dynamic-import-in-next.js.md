Next.js is a popular React framework that enables developers to create powerful, modern web applications. One of the most powerful features of Next.js is the ability to use dynamic imports, which allow you to load code on the fly, as needed. This can be useful for optimizing performance, as well as for loading components that are not needed on the initial page load.

However, when using dynamic imports with the Suspense component, developers often encounter errors. This is because the Suspense component is designed to work with React's lazy loading feature, which is not compatible with dynamic imports. This can lead to errors such as `TypeError: Cannot read property 'default' of undefined`.

In this article, we will discuss the common mistakes that lead to this error, and provide some examples of how to fix them.

## Common Mistakes

The most common mistake when using Suspense and dynamic imports together is attempting to use the Suspense component directly with the dynamic import. This will not work, as the Suspense component is designed to work with lazy loading, not dynamic imports.

Instead, the dynamic import must be wrapped in a `React.lazy` call, which will allow the Suspense component to work with the dynamic import.

```jsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const MyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

const App = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <MyComponent />
  </Suspense>
);
```

Another mistake is not providing a fallback element to the Suspense component. The fallback element is displayed while the dynamic import is being loaded, and is usually a loading indicator or some other placeholder.

```jsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const MyComponent = lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

const App = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <MyComponent />
  </Suspense>
);
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, when using Suspense and dynamic imports together in Next.js, it is important to avoid common mistakes such as attempting to use the Suspense component directly with the dynamic import, and not providing a fallback element to the Suspense component. By following these tips, you can ensure that your dynamic imports are properly loaded and displayed in your application.

Next.js is a popular React framework that allows developers to create server-rendered and statically generated applications with ease. It also provides a powerful API for dynamic imports, which allows for code splitting and lazy loading components. However, when using Suspense and Dynamic Import together, developers often encounter an error. In this blog post, we will explore what this error is, why it occurs, and how to fix it.

## What is the Error?

The error when using Suspense and Dynamic Import in Next.js is:

```
Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.
```

This error occurs when a developer attempts to use a Suspense component with a dynamic import.

## Why Does This Error Occur?

The reason why this error occurs is because Suspense and Dynamic Import are two separate APIs that are not designed to work together. 

The Suspense API is used to wrap a component that is loading asynchronously. When used, it will show a loading state until the component is ready. However, the Dynamic Import API is used to asynchronously load components. It does not have the ability to show a loading state, so when used with Suspense, it will cause an error.

## How to Fix the Error

Fortunately, there is a way to fix this error. The solution is to use the `<Suspense>` component with the `<React.lazy>` API.

The `<React.lazy>` API is designed to work with the Suspense API. It allows developers to asynchronously load components and show a loading state while the component is loading.

To use the `<React.lazy>` API, you need to wrap the dynamic import in a function. This function will return the imported component. Here is an example:

```javascript
const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));
```

Then, you can use the `<React.lazy>` component inside of a `<Suspense>` component. This will allow you to show a loading state while the component is being imported. Here is an example:

```javascript
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <MyComponent />
</Suspense>
```

In this example, the `fallback` prop is used to specify the loading state that will be displayed while the component is being imported.

## Conclusion

The error when using Suspense and Dynamic Import in Next.js is caused by the fact that the two APIs are not designed to work together. Fortunately, there is a way to fix this error by using the `<React.lazy>` API with the `<Suspense>` component. This will allow developers to asynchronously load components and show a loading state while the component is loading.
