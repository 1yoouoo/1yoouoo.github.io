ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. While ReactJS can be powerful, it can also be difficult to debug when errors occur on page load. This article will provide an overview of common ReactJS errors, as well as tips and tricks for troubleshooting them.

## Common ReactJS Errors

One of the most common ReactJS errors is a missing `React.createElement` call. This error occurs when a component is declared without a `React.createElement` call. For example, if we have a component declared like this:

```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  // ...
}
```

We will get the following error:

```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.
```

To fix this error, we need to add the `React.createElement` call:

```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  // ...
}

React.createElement(MyComponent);
```

Another common ReactJS error is a missing `key` prop. This error occurs when a component is declared without a `key` prop. For example, if we have a component declared like this:

```js
const MyComponent = () => {
  // ...
};
```

We will get the following error:

```
Error: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
```

To fix this error, we need to add the `key` prop:

```js
const MyComponent = () => {
  // ...
};

React.createElement(MyComponent, { key: 'my-component' });
```

## Troubleshooting ReactJS Errors

When troubleshooting ReactJS errors, the first step is to identify the source of the error. ReactJS errors can be caused by a variety of issues, including:

- Missing `React.createElement` calls
- Missing `key` props
- Incorrectly formatted props
- Incorrectly formatted components
- Incorrectly formatted JSX

Once the source of the error has been identified, the next step is to fix the issue. This can be done by:

- Adding the missing `React.createElement` call
- Adding the missing `key` prop
- Ensuring that props are correctly formatted
- Ensuring that components are correctly formatted
- Ensuring that JSX is correctly formatted

Finally, it's important to ensure that the code is tested thoroughly before deploying. This can be done by running unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure that the code is working as expected.

## Conclusion

Troubleshooting ReactJS errors can be a difficult and time-consuming process. However, with a bit of patience and the right tools, it is possible to identify and fix ReactJS errors. By following the tips and tricks outlined in this article, developers can quickly and effectively troubleshoot ReactJS errors on page load.

ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library used to create user interfaces. It is used by many developers to create modern web applications. However, when loading a page with ReactJS, you may run into errors that can be difficult to troubleshoot. In this blog post, we will take a look at some of the most common errors and how to solve them.

## Error 1: 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <'

This error occurs when the ReactJS code is not valid JavaScript. The most common cause of this error is an invalid HTML tag or an invalid JavaScript statement. To fix this error, you need to first identify the source of the invalid code.

In most cases, the error is caused by an HTML tag that is not properly closed. For example, if you have an opening `<div>` tag without a closing `</div>` tag, this will cause the error. To fix this, you need to add the missing closing tag.

Another common cause of this error is an invalid JavaScript statement. This could be caused by a missing semicolon, an incorrect variable name, or an invalid syntax. To fix this, you need to identify the source of the invalid statement and correct it.

## Error 2: 'Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined'

This error occurs when the ReactJS library is not loaded correctly. To fix this error, you need to make sure that the ReactJS library is correctly loaded in your HTML file.

To do this, you need to add a `<script>` tag with the `src` attribute set to the ReactJS library URL. For example, if you are using the CDN version of the library, you can add the following `<script>` tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.13.1/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
```

Once you have added the `<script>` tag, you should be able to successfully load the ReactJS library and the error should be resolved.

## Error 3: 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'xxx' of undefined'

This error occurs when a variable is not defined. To fix this error, you need to make sure that the variable is defined before it is used.

For example, if you are trying to access a property of an object and the object is not defined, this error will occur. To fix this, you need to make sure that the object is defined before you try to access its properties.

## Error 4: 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'xxx' of null'

This error occurs when a variable is defined but is set to `null`. To fix this error, you need to make sure that the variable is defined and is not set to `null`.

For example, if you are trying to access a property of an object and the object is set to `null`, this error will occur. To fix this, you need to make sure that the object is defined and is not set to `null`.

## Error 5: 'Uncaught TypeError: xxx is not a function'

This error occurs when a function is not defined. To fix this error, you need to make sure that the function is defined before it is called.

For example, if you are trying to call a function and the function is not defined, this error will occur. To fix this, you need to make sure that the function is defined before you try to call it.

## Error 6: 'Uncaught TypeError: xxx is not a constructor'

This error occurs when a constructor is not defined. To fix this error, you need to make sure that the constructor is defined before it is called.

For example, if you are trying to create an instance of a class and the class is not defined, this error will occur. To fix this, you need to make sure that the class is defined before you try to create an instance of it.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have looked at some of the most common ReactJS errors and how to troubleshoot them. By following the steps outlined in this post, you should be able to quickly identify and resolve any errors you may encounter when loading a page with ReactJS.
