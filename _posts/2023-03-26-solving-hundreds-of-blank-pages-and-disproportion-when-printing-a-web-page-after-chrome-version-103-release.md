Since the release of Chrome version 103, many users have experienced issues with printing web pages. When attempting to print a web page, hundreds of blank pages are generated, or the page is printed with a distorted or disproportioned layout. This issue can be frustrating and time consuming to fix, but thankfully there are several solutions that can help.

## Common Mistakes

The most common mistake that causes this issue is when the web page’s content is too large for the page size that is being printed. This can cause the page to be printed with a distorted or disproportioned layout. Another common mistake is when the browser’s print settings are not configured correctly. If the page size, margins, or other settings are not set correctly, this can also cause the page to be printed with a distorted or disproportioned layout.

## Javascript or Typescript Code

To help solve this issue, it is important to ensure that your web page’s content is not too large for the page size that is being printed. This can be done by using the following Javascript or Typescript code:

```javascript
let pageSize = getPageSize();
let pageContent = getPageContent();

if (pageContent.length > pageSize.width * pageSize.height) {
  alert('Page content is too large for the page size!');
}
```

In this code, we are using the `getPageSize()` and `getPageContent()` functions to get the size of the page and the content of the page respectively. We then compare the length of the page content with the width and height of the page size to determine if the content is too large. If it is, then an alert is displayed to the user.

## Configure Browser Print Settings

It is also important to ensure that the browser’s print settings are configured correctly. This can be done by using the following Javascript or Typescript code:

```javascript
let pageSize = getPageSize();
let pageMargins = getPageMargins();

if (pageMargins.left + pageMargins.right >= pageSize.width) {
  alert('Page margins are too large for the page size!');
}
```

In this code, we are using the `getPageSize()` and `getPageMargins()` functions to get the size of the page and the margins of the page respectively. We then compare the sum of the left and right margins with the width of the page size to determine if the margins are too large. If they are, then an alert is displayed to the user.

## Use Print Preview

Finally, it is important to use the print preview feature to ensure that the page is being printed correctly. This can be done by using the following Javascript or Typescript code:

```javascript
let pageContent = getPageContent();
let printPreview = getPrintPreview();

if (pageContent !== printPreview) {
  alert('Page content is not being printed correctly!');
}
```

In this code, we are using the `getPageContent()` and `getPrintPreview()` functions to get the content of the page and the print preview of the page respectively. We then compare the page content with the print preview to determine if the page is being printed correctly. If it is not, then an alert is displayed to the user.

## Conclusion

Solving hundreds of blank pages and disproportion when printing a web page after Chrome version 103 release can be a frustrating and time consuming task. However, by following the solutions outlined in this article, users can quickly and easily resolve this issue. By ensuring that the web page’s content is not too large for the page size, configuring the browser’s print settings correctly, and using the print preview feature, users can ensure that their web pages are printed correctly.
