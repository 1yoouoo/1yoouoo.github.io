If you have been developing in JavaScript for any length of time, you have likely encountered the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error. This error is particularly common when using the popular library Axios for making API calls. In this article, we'll explore some of the common causes of this error, and how to solve them.

## What is the 'Cannot use import statement outside a module' Error?

The `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error is raised when a script written in a `.js` file or a script tag attempts to import a module. This error occurs because `import` and `export` statements can only be used in files that are explicitly marked as modules, such as `.mjs` or `.jsx` files.

## Common Causes of the Error

There are several common causes of the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error. These include:

- **Using `import` or `export` in a `.js` file**: As mentioned above, `import` and `export` statements can only be used in files that are explicitly marked as modules. This means that if you try to use an `import` statement in a `.js` file, you will get the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error.

- **Using `require()` instead of `import`**: The `require()` function is used to import modules in Node.js, but it cannot be used in the browser. If you try to use `require()` in a browser-based script, you will get the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error.

- **Using `import` without a module loader**: The `import` statement requires a module loader, such as Webpack or Browserify, to be able to work in the browser. If you try to use `import` without a module loader, you will get the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error.

## Troubleshooting the Error

Now that we know some of the common causes of the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error, let's look at how to solve it.

### Use `import` or `export` in a `.mjs` or `.jsx` File

The easiest way to solve the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error is to make sure that you are using `import` or `export` statements in a `.mjs` or `.jsx` file. This will ensure that the file is explicitly marked as a module, and the `import` or `export` statements will work as expected.

### Use `import` instead of `require()`

If you are trying to use `require()` in a browser-based script, you will need to use `import` instead. `import` is the standard way to import modules in the browser, and it is supported by all modern browsers.

### Use a Module Loader

In order to use `import` in the browser, you will need to use a module loader, such as Webpack or Browserify. Module loaders allow you to use `import` and `export` statements in the browser, and they are essential for using modules in the browser.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the `Cannot use import statement outside a module` error, and how to solve it. We looked at some of the common causes of the error, and how to troubleshoot it. We also discussed the importance of using `import` or `export` in a `.mjs` or `.jsx` file, using `import` instead of `require()`, and using a module loader.

The `import` statement is a powerful feature of the JavaScript and TypeScript language that allows us to import code from other files and libraries. However, when using the `import` statement with the popular library [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), we may encounter an error: *Cannot use import statement outside a module*. This error can be very confusing and frustrating, but it's actually quite simple to solve. In this post, we'll take a look at what causes this error and how to fix it.

## What Causes the 'Cannot use import statement outside a module' Error?

The `import` statement can only be used in code that is run in a module environment. This means that if you are trying to use the `import` statement in a script that is not running in a module environment, you will get the error *Cannot use import statement outside a module*.

When using Axios, this error can occur if you are trying to use the `import` statement in a script that is not running in a module environment. For example, if you are using Axios in a Node.js script, you must ensure that the script is running in a module environment.

## How to Fix the 'Cannot use import statement outside a module' Error

Fortunately, the fix for this error is quite simple. All you need to do is ensure that your script is running in a module environment. This can be done by adding the `--experimental-modules` flag when running the script.

For example, if you are running the script with Node.js, you can use the following command:

```
node --experimental-modules my-script.js
```

This will ensure that the script is running in a module environment, which will allow you to use the `import` statement.

## Using Axios with the 'import' Statement

Once you have ensured that your script is running in a module environment, you can now use the `import` statement to import the Axios library. Here is an example of how to do this:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/api');
console.log(response.data);
```

In this example, we are using the `import` statement to import the Axios library. We can then use the `axios.get()` method to make an HTTP request to the specified URL.

## Conclusion

The `import` statement is a powerful feature of the JavaScript and TypeScript language, but it can only be used in code that is running in a module environment. If you are trying to use the `import` statement in a script that is not running in a module environment, you will get the error *Cannot use import statement outside a module*.

Fortunately, the fix for this error is quite simple. All you need to do is ensure that your script is running in a module environment. This can be done by adding the `--experimental-modules` flag when running the script. Once you have ensured that your script is running in a module environment, you can then use the `import` statement to import the Axios library and make HTTP requests.
