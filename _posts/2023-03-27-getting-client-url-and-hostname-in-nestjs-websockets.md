NestJS is a popular Node.js web framework that allows developers to easily create web applications and APIs. It provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs, including built-in support for WebSockets.

However, when it comes to getting the client URL and hostname from within a NestJS WebSocket connection, things can get a bit tricky. In this article, we will look at how to get the client URL and hostname from within a NestJS WebSocket connection.

## Common Mistakes

One of the most common mistakes developers make when trying to get the client URL and hostname from within a NestJS WebSocket connection is not using the `connection.handshake` method. The `connection.handshake` method is used to get the client URL and hostname from within the connection.

Another common mistake is not using the `connection.request` method. The `connection.request` method is used to get the request object associated with the connection. This is necessary in order to get the client URL and hostname.

## Getting the Client URL and Hostname

In order to get the client URL and hostname from within a NestJS WebSocket connection, we need to use the `connection.handshake` and `connection.request` methods.

First, we need to get the request object associated with the connection. We can do this by using the `connection.request` method:

```typescript
const request = connection.request;
```

Next, we need to get the client URL and hostname from the request object. We can do this by using the `connection.handshake` method:

```typescript
const { url, hostname } = connection.handshake(request);
```

The `url` and `hostname` variables now contain the client URL and hostname respectively.

## Using the Client URL and Hostname

Once we have the client URL and hostname, we can use them in our application. For example, we can use the `url` variable to determine which page the user is on and the `hostname` variable to determine which server the user is connected to.

We can also use the `url` and `hostname` variables to track user activity, such as which pages they are visiting and which servers they are connecting to. This can be useful for analytics purposes.

## Conclusion

In this article, we looked at how to get the client URL and hostname from within a NestJS WebSocket connection. We saw that we need to use the `connection.handshake` and `connection.request` methods to get the client URL and hostname. We also saw how we can use the `url` and `hostname` variables to track user activity.

Websockets are a powerful tool for real-time communication on the web. They allow for bidirectional communication between a client and a server, and can be used for a variety of applications including chat, gaming, and more.

NestJS is a popular framework for building Node.js applications, and it provides a powerful set of tools for working with websockets. However, one common issue that developers run into is getting the client URL and hostname when working with websockets. 

In this blog post, we'll explore how to get the client URL and hostname when working with websockets in NestJS. We'll look at the code needed to do this, as well as some tips and tricks for troubleshooting any issues you might encounter. 

## Getting the Client URL and Hostname

The first step in getting the client URL and hostname is to set up the websocket server. To do this, we'll use NestJS's built-in `WebSocketServer` class. This class is used to create a websocket server that can handle incoming connections from clients. 

Once the websocket server is set up, we can use the `onConnection` method to handle incoming connections. This method takes a callback function that will be called whenever a new connection is established. The callback function takes two arguments: the `client` object and the `request` object. 

The `request` object contains information about the client's request, including the client's URL and hostname. To get the client's URL and hostname, we can use the `request.url` and `request.hostname` properties, respectively. 

Here's an example of how to get the client's URL and hostname using the `onConnection` method:

```typescript
import { WebSocketServer } from '@nestjs/websockets';

const wss = new WebSocketServer();

wss.onConnection(client => {
  const { url, hostname } = client.request;
  console.log(`Client URL: ${url}`);
  console.log(`Client Hostname: ${hostname}`);
});
```

In this example, we create a new instance of the `WebSocketServer` class and use the `onConnection` method to handle incoming connections. The `onConnection` method takes a callback function that takes the `client` object and the `request` object. We then use the `request.url` and `request.hostname` properties to get the client's URL and hostname, respectively. 

## Troubleshooting Issues

While getting the client URL and hostname in NestJS websockets is relatively straightforward, there are a few potential issues that you might run into. 

The most common issue is that the `request` object might be `null` when the `onConnection` method is called. This can happen if the `WebSocketServer` is not properly configured. To fix this issue, make sure that the `WebSocketServer` is configured correctly and that the `request` object is being passed to the `onConnection` method. 

Another issue that can arise is that the `request.url` and `request.hostname` properties might not be populated correctly. This can happen if the websocket server is not properly configured. To fix this issue, make sure that the websocket server is configured correctly and that the `url` and `hostname` properties are being set correctly. 

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we looked at how to get the client URL and hostname when working with websockets in NestJS. We explored the code needed to do this, as well as some tips and tricks for troubleshooting any issues you might encounter. 

Getting the client URL and hostname in NestJS websockets is a relatively straightforward process, but it's important to make sure that the websocket server is properly configured and that the `request` object is being passed to the `onConnection` method. Additionally, make sure that the `url` and `hostname` properties are being set correctly. 

By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you should be able to get the client URL and hostname when working with websockets in NestJS. Good luck!
