React 18 introduced a new feature, Function Components (FC), which allows developers to write components as functions instead of classes. This new feature is great, but it can come with a few errors that need to be troubleshooted. One common error is the "TypeScript Children FC Error". This error occurs when a React component is written as a function but it has children. In this article, we’ll discuss what this error is, why it happens, and how to fix it.

## What is the TypeScript Children FC Error?

The TypeScript Children FC Error occurs when a React component is written as a function, but it has children. In this case, the TypeScript compiler will throw an error saying that the component’s children are not valid. This error is caused by the fact that React components written as functions can only return one element, and any children of that element must be wrapped in a single element.

## Why Does the TypeScript Children FC Error Occur?

The TypeScript Children FC Error occurs because React components written as functions can only return one element, and any children of that element must be wrapped in a single element. This is because React components written as functions are not able to return multiple elements, so any children of the component must be wrapped in a single element.

For example, if you have a React component written as a function that looks like this:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Component</h1>
      <p>Hello, world!</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This will throw the TypeScript Children FC Error, because the component is returning multiple elements (the `<div>` and the `<h1>` and `<p>` tags). To fix this, you need to wrap the children in a single element, like this:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Component</h1>
      <p>Hello, world!</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Now the component is only returning one element (the `<div>` tag), and the `<h1>` and `<p>` tags are wrapped in it, so the TypeScript compiler will not throw an error.

## How to Fix the TypeScript Children FC Error

The best way to fix the TypeScript Children FC Error is to make sure that any React components written as functions are only returning one element, and any children of that element are wrapped in a single element. This can be done by wrapping the children in a `<div>` tag, as shown in the example above.

It’s also important to make sure that the type of the React component is set to `React.FC` when writing components as functions. This is because the type of the component needs to be set to `React.FC` in order for the TypeScript compiler to recognize it as a function component.

## Conclusion

The TypeScript Children FC Error is a common error that occurs when a React component is written as a function but it has children. The error is caused by the fact that React components written as functions can only return one element, and any children of that element must be wrapped in a single element. To fix this error, make sure that any React components written as functions are only returning one element, and any children of that element are wrapped in a single element, and make sure that the type of the React component is set to `React.FC`.

React 18 and TypeScript can be a powerful combination for developing web applications, but it can also be a source of frustration when errors arise. One such error is the dreaded "Children FC" error, which can be especially difficult to debug. In this post, we'll take a look at the cause of this error and how to fix it. 

## What is the Children FC Error?

The Children FC error is a TypeScript error that occurs when you attempt to pass a React component as a child to another component. It looks something like this:

```
Type '{ children: React.FC<{}>; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & { children?: ReactNode; }'.
  Types of property 'children' are incompatible.
    Type 'React.FC<{}>' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'.
      Type 'FC<{}>' is not assignable to type 'ReactElement<any, string | ((props: any) => ReactElement<any, string | ... | (new (props: any) => Component<any, any, any>)> | null) | (new (props: any) => Component<any, any, any>)>'.
        Type '{}' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & { children?: ReactNode; }'.
```

In plain English, this error is telling us that we are trying to pass a component as a child to another component, but this is not allowed. To understand why this is the case, let's take a look at what React components are and how they are used.

## What are React Components?

React components are pieces of code that can be used to create user interfaces. They are written in JavaScript or TypeScript, and they can be composed of other components. A component is composed of two parts: props and children. Props are data that is passed to the component, while children are components or elements that are passed as children to the component.

## Why is Passing a Component as a Child Not Allowed?

When React is trying to render a component, it needs to know what props and children to pass to the component. When you pass a component as a child, React does not know what props and children to pass to the component. Therefore, React throws an error when you attempt to pass a component as a child.

## How to Fix the Children FC Error

The Children FC error can be fixed by passing a function as a child instead of a component. This function should return a React element or component that can be rendered.

For example, let's say we have a component called `ParentComponent`. We want to pass a component called `ChildComponent` as a child to `ParentComponent`. To do this, we can create a function called `renderChildComponent` that returns `ChildComponent`:

```js
// ParentComponent.js

import React from "react";
import ChildComponent from "./ChildComponent";

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const renderChildComponent = () => {
    return <ChildComponent />;
  };

  return <div>{renderChildComponent()}</div>;
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

Now, instead of passing `ChildComponent` directly as a child to `ParentComponent`, we are passing the `renderChildComponent` function, which returns `ChildComponent`. This allows React to render `ChildComponent` without throwing an error.

## Conclusion

The Children FC error can be a frustrating error to debug, but with a bit of knowledge about React components and how they are used, it can be easily fixed. By passing a function as a child instead of a component, you can avoid this error and ensure that your React application runs smoothly.
