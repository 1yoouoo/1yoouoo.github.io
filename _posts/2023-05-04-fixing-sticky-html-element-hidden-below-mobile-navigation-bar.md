In this tutorial, we'll look at how to fix a sticky HTML element hidden below a mobile navigation bar. This issue can be caused by a variety of factors, and it can be difficult to diagnose and fix. We'll walk through the steps to identify and resolve this issue, as well as provide some tips on how to prevent it from happening in the future.

## What Causes Sticky HTML Element Hidden Below Mobile Navigation Bar?

The cause of a sticky HTML element hidden below a mobile navigation bar is often due to a combination of factors. The most common culprits are:

- **CSS positioning**: The element is positioned using `position: fixed` or `position: absolute`, which causes it to remain fixed to the screen regardless of the user's scroll position.

- **CSS overflow**: The element's parent container has an `overflow` set to `hidden` or `auto`, which prevents the element from being visible when the user scrolls.

- **Viewport width**: The element's width is greater than the viewport width, which causes some of the element to be hidden when the user scrolls.

- **Mobile navigation**: The mobile navigation bar is positioned above the element, which causes it to be hidden when the user scrolls.

## How to Fix Sticky HTML Element Hidden Below Mobile Navigation Bar

The first step to fixing a sticky HTML element hidden below a mobile navigation bar is to identify the cause of the issue. Once you've identified the cause, you can then take the appropriate steps to fix the issue. Let's take a look at some of the most common solutions.

### 1. Adjust the CSS Positioning

If the issue is caused by incorrect CSS positioning, the solution is to adjust the positioning of the element. For example, if the element is currently positioned with `position: fixed`, you can change it to `position: relative` or `position: sticky`. This will allow the element to move with the user's scroll position and be visible when the user scrolls.

### 2. Adjust the CSS Overflow

If the issue is caused by incorrect CSS overflow, the solution is to adjust the overflow of the element's parent container. For example, if the parent container is currently set to `overflow: hidden`, you can change it to `overflow: visible` or `overflow: auto`. This will allow the element to be visible when the user scrolls.

### 3. Adjust the Viewport Width

If the issue is caused by the element's width being greater than the viewport width, the solution is to adjust the width of the element. You can do this by setting the `width` property to a value that is equal to or less than the viewport width. This will ensure that the element is always visible when the user scrolls.

### 4. Adjust the Mobile Navigation

If the issue is caused by the mobile navigation bar being positioned above the element, the solution is to adjust the position of the mobile navigation bar. You can do this by setting the `z-index` property of the mobile navigation bar to a higher value than the element. This will ensure that the element is always visible when the user scrolls.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we looked at how to fix a sticky HTML element hidden below a mobile navigation bar. We discussed the most common causes of this issue and provided solutions for each. With these tips, you should be able to quickly identify and resolve this issue.

Mobile navigation bars are an essential part of modern web design. They are used to provide quick and easy access to the rest of the website's content. Unfortunately, they can also cause problems when it comes to sticky elements.

When a website has a sticky element such as a header or footer, it often remains visible even when the mobile navigation bar is opened. This can lead to the sticky element being hidden behind the navigation bar, making it difficult for the user to access.

Fortunately, there is a way to fix this issue. By using a bit of JavaScript or TypeScript, we can ensure that the sticky element is always visible, even when the mobile navigation bar is open.

## Step 1: Add the JavaScript or TypeScript Code

The first step is to add the following code to the website:

```javascript
// Get the navigation bar element
const navBar = document.querySelector('.nav-bar');

// Create an event listener for when the navigation bar is opened
navBar.addEventListener('open', () => {
    // Get the sticky element
    const stickyElement = document.querySelector('.sticky-element');

    // Set the sticky element's position to fixed
    stickyElement.style.position = 'fixed';
});

// Create an event listener for when the navigation bar is closed
navBar.addEventListener('close', () => {
    // Get the sticky element
    const stickyElement = document.querySelector('.sticky-element');

    // Set the sticky element's position back to its original position
    stickyElement.style.position = 'relative';
});
```

This code will add two event listeners to the navigation bar. The first will be triggered when the navigation bar is opened, and it will set the sticky element's position to `fixed`. This will ensure that the sticky element is always visible, even when the navigation bar is open.

The second event listener will be triggered when the navigation bar is closed, and it will set the sticky element's position back to its original position. This will ensure that the sticky element is not visible when the navigation bar is closed.

## Step 2: Test the Code

Once the code has been added, it's time to test it. Open the website in a mobile browser and open the navigation bar. The sticky element should now be visible, even when the navigation bar is open.

## Step 3: Tweak the Code

Once the code has been tested and is working correctly, it's time to tweak it. Depending on the design of the website, the code may need to be tweaked in order to make sure that the sticky element is always visible.

For example, if the sticky element is positioned in the middle of the page, the code may need to be changed so that it sets the sticky element's position to `fixed` when the navigation bar is opened, and to `absolute` when it is closed. This will ensure that the sticky element is always visible, even when the navigation bar is open.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have seen how to fix the issue of sticky elements being hidden behind the mobile navigation bar. By using a bit of JavaScript or TypeScript, we can ensure that the sticky element is always visible, even when the navigation bar is open.

By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you should now have a website that is free from this issue.
