When trying to bundle a React-Native application, you may encounter an error that looks like this: 

```
error: bundling failed: Error: Unable to resolve module `idb` from `node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js`: Module `idb` does not exist in the Haste module map
```

This error occurs when the bundling process cannot find the `idb` module, which is used to support IndexedDB in the React-Native application. The `idb` module is a part of the Expo SDK, which is used to build React-Native applications.

## Common Mistakes

There are two common mistakes that can lead to this error:

1. Not including the `idb` module in the Expo SDK.
2. Not including the `idb` module in the `package.json` file.

## Including the `idb` Module in the Expo SDK

In order to include the `idb` module in the Expo SDK, you must first install the Expo SDK using npm or yarn. After that, you can add the `idb` module to the `node_modules` directory in your project.

```
$ npm install expo
$ cd node_modules/expo
$ npm install idb
```

Once the `idb` module has been installed, you can then add the `idb` module to the `AppEntry.js` file. This is done by adding the following line of code to the `AppEntry.js` file:

```js
import idb from 'idb';
```

## Including the `idb` Module in the `package.json` File

In addition to including the `idb` module in the Expo SDK, you must also include the `idb` module in the `package.json` file. This is done by adding the following line of code to the `dependencies` section of the `package.json` file:

```json
"idb": "^2.0.0"
```

Once the `idb` module has been added to the `package.json` file, you can then run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the `idb` module.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the `idb` module must be included in both the Expo SDK and the `package.json` file in order to successfully bundle a React-Native application. If the `idb` module is not included in either of these locations, the bundling process will fail and the error `error: bundling failed: Error: Unable to resolve module `idb` from `node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js`: Module `idb` does not exist in the Haste module map` will be displayed.

React-Native bundling is a process of combining all JavaScript components and resources into a single file, which is then sent to the mobile device. This process is necessary in order to ensure that the app is running properly and efficiently. However, sometimes the bundling process can fail, resulting in an error message that says “idb” module not found.

This error can be caused by a variety of factors, including incorrect configuration of the React-Native project, missing dependencies, or an outdated version of the React-Native library. In this article, we will discuss how to troubleshoot this error and get your React-Native project back up and running.

## Step 1: Check Your Configuration

The first step in troubleshooting this error is to check your configuration. Make sure that you have the correct version of React-Native installed and that all of the necessary dependencies are present in your project. Additionally, check that you have the correct configuration in your `package.json` file.

## Step 2: Check Your Dependencies

Next, check your dependencies. Make sure that all of the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file are present and up to date. If any of the dependencies are out of date or missing, you may need to install them manually.

## Step 3: Check Your Code

Once you have checked your configuration and dependencies, it is time to check your code. Look for any references to the `idb` module in your code and make sure that they are valid. Additionally, check that all of the necessary imports are present and that all of the necessary variables are declared.

## Step 4: Update Your Version of React-Native

If all of the above steps have been completed and the error persists, it is time to update your version of React-Native. Make sure that you are running the latest version of React-Native and that all of the necessary dependencies are present.

## Step 5: Rebuild the Bundle

Finally, if all of the above steps have been completed and the error still persists, it is time to rebuild the bundle. To do this, you will need to open a terminal window and run the following command:

```
react-native bundle --entry-file index.js --platform ios --dev false --bundle-output ios/main.jsbundle --assets-dest ios
```

This command will generate a new bundle for your project. Once the bundle has been generated, you should be able to deploy it to your device and the error should be resolved.

## Conclusion

The “idb” module not found error can be a frustrating one to troubleshoot, but with the right steps it can be resolved quickly. Make sure to check your configuration, dependencies, and code before attempting to rebuild the bundle. With the right steps, you should be able to get your React-Native project up and running in no time.
