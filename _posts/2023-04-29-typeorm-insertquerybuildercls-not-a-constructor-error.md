Are you getting a TypeORM `InsertQueryBuilderCls` not a constructor error when trying to create a query builder in TypeORM? If so, you're not alone. This is a common error that can be caused by a variety of issues, but luckily it's usually easy to fix. In this article, we'll go over some of the most common causes of this error and how to fix them.

The TypeORM `InsertQueryBuilderCls` not a constructor error occurs when trying to create a query builder in TypeORM. This error is caused by a few different things, but the most common cause is a misconfigured or outdated TypeORM setup.

The first step in troubleshooting this error is to make sure that your TypeORM setup is up to date. If your TypeORM setup is not up to date, you may need to update it to the latest version. Additionally, you should check your TypeORM configuration to make sure that it is correct.

If your TypeORM setup is up to date and your configuration is correct, the next step is to check your code for any potential errors. Specifically, you should check for any potential typos or mistakes in your query builder code. For example, if you're using the `createQueryBuilder` function, make sure that the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` parameter is correctly spelled.

```javascript
// Correct
const queryBuilder = connection.createQueryBuilder(InsertQueryBuilderCls);

// Incorrect
const queryBuilder = connection.createQueryBuilder(InsertQueryBuildCls);
```

Additionally, you should also make sure that you're using the correct query builder class. For example, if you're using the `createQueryBuilder` function, make sure that you're passing in the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class.

```javascript
// Correct
const queryBuilder = connection.createQueryBuilder(InsertQueryBuilderCls);

// Incorrect
const queryBuilder = connection.createQueryBuilder(SelectQueryBuilderCls);
```

Finally, you should also make sure that the query builder class is correctly imported. If you're using the `createQueryBuilder` function, make sure that you're importing the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class from the correct module.

```javascript
// Correct
import { InsertQueryBuilderCls } from 'typeorm';

// Incorrect
import { InsertQueryBuilderCls } from 'typeorm-plus';
```

These are just a few of the most common causes of the TypeORM `InsertQueryBuilderCls` not a constructor error. If you're still having trouble troubleshooting this error, you may need to consult the TypeORM documentation or a professional developer.

If you are a TypeORM user, you might have encountered the `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error. This error usually occurs when trying to execute a query builder. It can be quite frustrating and difficult to understand, but don't worry, this blog post will provide you with a step-by-step solution to this problem. 

## What is TypeORM?

TypeORM is an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript. It is used to interact with databases and provides an easy way to create, read, update, and delete data. It also provides a powerful query builder for creating and executing database queries.

## What is the InsertQueryBuilderCls error?

The `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error is a common issue when using TypeORM. This error occurs when you try to use the `InsertQueryBuilder` class to create and execute a database query.

The `InsertQueryBuilder` class is a subclass of the `QueryBuilder` class, and it is responsible for creating and executing insert queries. When you try to use the `InsertQueryBuilder` class, the TypeORM library throws an error saying that `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor`.

## What causes the InsertQueryBuilderCls error?

The `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error is caused by a few different things. The most common cause is a syntax error in the code. This can happen if you are using the wrong syntax when creating an instance of the `InsertQueryBuilder` class.

Another common cause of this error is an issue with the TypeORM library itself. If you are using an outdated version of TypeORM, it may cause the error to occur.

## How to fix the InsertQueryBuilderCls error

To fix the `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error, you need to check your code for any syntax errors and make sure you are using the correct syntax when creating an instance of the `InsertQueryBuilder` class.

You should also make sure you are using the latest version of TypeORM. If you are using an outdated version, you should upgrade to the latest version.

If you are still having issues after checking your code and updating TypeORM, you should try using the `QueryBuilder` class instead of the `InsertQueryBuilder` class. The `QueryBuilder` class is more versatile and can be used to create and execute insert queries.

## Example code

Here is an example of code that will throw the `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error:

```typescript
// Wrong syntax
const query = new InsertQueryBuilderCls();

// Correct syntax
const query = new InsertQueryBuilder();
```

In the example above, the wrong syntax is used to create an instance of the `InsertQueryBuilder` class. This will cause the TypeORM library to throw an error saying that `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor`. The correct syntax should be used instead, which is `new InsertQueryBuilder()`.

## Conclusion

The `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error is a common issue when using TypeORM. This error occurs when you try to use the `InsertQueryBuilder` class to create and execute a database query. To fix this error, you need to check your code for any syntax errors and make sure you are using the correct syntax when creating an instance of the `InsertQueryBuilder` class. You should also make sure you are using the latest version of TypeORM. If you are still having issues, you should try using the `QueryBuilder` class instead of the `InsertQueryBuilder` class.
