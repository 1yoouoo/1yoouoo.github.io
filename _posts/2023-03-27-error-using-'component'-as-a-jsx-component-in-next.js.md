Next.js is a powerful React framework for building server-side rendered React applications. It is an open-source project created and maintained by Vercel and has gained popularity in the React community for its ease of use and flexibility. One of the most common mistakes when developing with Next.js is using the `Component` keyword as a JSX component.

In React, the `Component` keyword is used to create a React component class. It is used to create a new component that can be used in the JSX of the application. However, `Component` is not a valid JSX component and will throw an error when used in Next.js.

## What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like syntax directly in their JavaScript code. It is used in React to create and render components.

## What is the `Component` keyword?

The `Component` keyword is used to create a React component class. It is used to create a new component that can be used in the JSX of the application. It is used to create a class that extends the base `React.Component` class and can be used to create a component with its own state, props, and lifecycle methods.

## Why does using `Component` as a JSX component throw an error?

When using `Component` as a JSX component in Next.js, an error is thrown because `Component` is not a valid JSX component. It is used to create a React component class, not to render a component.

To render a component, you must use a valid JSX component. This could be a user-defined component, such as a `<MyComponent />` or a built-in component, such as a `<button />`.

## Common mistakes when using `Component` as a JSX component

When using `Component` as a JSX component in Next.js, there are two common mistakes that developers make:

1. **Using `Component` instead of a valid JSX component**: When using `Component` as a JSX component, an error is thrown because `Component` is not a valid JSX component. To render a component, you must use a valid JSX component. This could be a user-defined component, such as a `<MyComponent />` or a built-in component, such as a `<button />`.

2. **Using `Component` as a prop instead of a valid JSX component**: When using `Component` as a prop, an error is thrown because `Component` is not a valid JSX component. To pass a component as a prop, you must use a valid JSX component. This could be a user-defined component, such as a `<MyComponent />` or a built-in component, such as a `<button />`.

## Example of using `Component` as a JSX component

Below is an example of using `Component` as a JSX component in Next.js:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Component /> // This will throw an error
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the `Component` keyword is used as a JSX component. This will throw an error because `Component` is not a valid JSX component. To render a component, you must use a valid JSX component. This could be a user-defined component, such as a `<MyComponent />` or a built-in component, such as a `<button />`.

## Example of using a valid JSX component

Below is an example of using a valid JSX component in Next.js:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MyComponent /> // This will not throw an error
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the `MyComponent` component is used as a JSX component. This will not throw an error because `MyComponent` is a valid JSX component. This component is a user-defined component that has been imported from the `./MyComponent` file.

## Conclusion

Using `Component` as a JSX component in Next.js will throw an error because `Component` is not a valid JSX component. To render a component, you must use a valid JSX component. This could be a user-defined component, such as a `<MyComponent />` or a built-in component, such as a `<button />`.

If you're developing an application with Next.js, you may have encountered the following error: `Error: Cannot find module 'Component' from 'pages'.` This error is caused when you use `Component` as a JSX component in your Next.js application.

## What Causes This Error?

The `Component` keyword is used in React to create a component class. In Next.js, however, the `Component` keyword is not supported. This is because Next.js uses a different way of creating components. Instead of using the `Component` keyword, Next.js uses the `_app.js` and `_document.js` files.

## How to Fix This Error

To fix this error, you need to replace the `Component` keyword with a `_app.js` or `_document.js` file. Let's look at an example of how to do this.

In the example below, we have a `Component` keyword in a `pages/index.js` file.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Index() {
  return <Component>Hello World!</Component>;
}
```

To fix this error, we need to replace the `Component` keyword with a `_app.js` or `_document.js` file. For example, we can create an `_app.js` file in the `pages` directory and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

Then, we need to update the `pages/index.js` file to use the `MyApp` component instead of the `Component` keyword.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import MyApp from './_app';

export default function Index() {
  return <MyApp>Hello World!</MyApp>;
}
```

Now, when you run the application, it should no longer give the `Error: Cannot find module 'Component' from 'pages'` error.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we looked at how to fix the `Error: Cannot find module 'Component' from 'pages'` error in a Next.js application. We saw that the error is caused by using the `Component` keyword in a Next.js application and that the solution is to replace the `Component` keyword with a `_app.js` or `_document.js` file. We then saw how to create an `_app.js` file and how to update the `pages/index.js` file to use the `MyApp` component instead of the `Component` keyword.
