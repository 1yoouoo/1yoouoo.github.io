CSS animations are a powerful tool for creating visually appealing webpages. However, they can be tricky to get working properly on certain browsers, particularly Safari and iOS. In this article, we'll discuss some of the common mistakes people make when trying to get CSS animations working on Safari and iOS, as well as provide some tips for troubleshooting them.

## Common Mistakes

When troubleshooting CSS animations on Safari and iOS, it's important to be aware of some of the common mistakes people make. Some of the most common mistakes include:

* Not using the correct vendor prefixes.
* Not using the correct syntax.
* Not using the correct animation properties.
* Not using the correct animation timing functions.
* Not using the correct keyframes.

## Vendor Prefixes

When using CSS animations on Safari and iOS, it's important to use the correct vendor prefixes. Vendor prefixes are a way of telling the browser which vendor's implementation of a particular feature to use. For example, the -webkit- prefix is used to tell the browser to use the WebKit implementation of the feature, while the -moz- prefix is used to tell the browser to use the Mozilla implementation of the feature.

For example, if you want to use the CSS animation property `animation`, you would need to use the vendor prefixes `-webkit-animation` and `-moz-animation`.

## Syntax

When writing CSS animations, it's important to use the correct syntax. This includes using the correct punctuation, such as semicolons, as well as the correct property names and values. For example, the following code would not work in Safari and iOS because it is missing the semicolon after the `animation-duration` property:

```css
.example {
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 2s
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}
```

The correct syntax would be:

```css
.example {
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}
```

## Animation Properties

When writing CSS animations, it's important to use the correct animation properties. These properties include `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`, `animation-delay`, and `animation-iteration-count`. Each of these properties has its own syntax and values, so it's important to make sure they are written correctly.

For example, the `animation-name` property is used to specify the name of the animation, while the `animation-duration` property is used to specify the length of time the animation will take to complete. The `animation-timing-function` property is used to specify the timing function of the animation, while the `animation-delay` property is used to specify the amount of time before the animation begins. Finally, the `animation-iteration-count` property is used to specify the number of times the animation will repeat.

## Animation Timing Functions

When writing CSS animations, it's important to use the correct animation timing functions. These functions are used to specify how the animation will progress over time. For example, the `ease` timing function will cause the animation to start slowly and then accelerate, while the `linear` timing function will cause the animation to progress at a constant speed.

## Keyframes

When writing CSS animations, it's important to use the correct keyframes. Keyframes are used to specify the start and end points of an animation, as well as any intermediate steps in between. For example, the following code would create an animation that starts at 0%, progresses to 50%, and then ends at 100%:

```css
@keyframes example {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 0.5;
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Troubleshooting CSS animations on Safari and iOS can be tricky, but with the right knowledge and tools, it can be done. Be sure to use the correct vendor prefixes, syntax, animation properties, animation timing functions, and keyframes. With these tips, you should be able to get your CSS animations working properly on Safari and iOS.

If you're a web developer, you may have encountered a frustrating problem: your animations don't seem to be working on Safari and iOS. This is a common issue, and it can be a real headache trying to figure out why your animations won't work.

Fortunately, there are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue and get your animations working in no time. We'll go over the most common causes of animation issues and how to fix them.

## Causes of Animation Issues

The most common causes of animation issues in Safari and iOS are related to the way the browser handles CSS animations. Safari and iOS are stricter than other browsers when it comes to animation code, so it's important to make sure your code is up to the browser's standards.

Here are some of the most common causes of animation issues:

- **Incorrect syntax:** If you're using CSS animations, it's important to make sure your code is written correctly. Incorrect syntax can cause your animations to not work properly.

- **Incompatible browsers:** Some browsers, such as Internet Explorer, do not support CSS animations. If you're trying to use animations in an unsupported browser, they won't work.

- **Incorrect vendor prefixes:** Some browsers require vendor prefixes to be included in your code. If you're missing a vendor prefix, your animations may not work.

- **Incorrect animation properties:** Animation properties, such as `animation-duration` and `animation-delay`, must be set correctly for your animations to work properly.

## Troubleshooting Animation Issues

Now that we've gone over the most common causes of animation issues, let's look at how to troubleshoot them. Here are some steps you can take to get your animations working properly:

- **Check your syntax:** The first step is to make sure your code is written correctly. Check for any typos or incorrect syntax, and make sure your code matches the syntax used in the documentation.

- **Check for vendor prefixes:** If you're using vendor prefixes, make sure you're using the correct ones for the browser you're targeting. You can find a list of vendor prefixes [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_browsersupport.asp).

- **Check the animation properties:** Make sure the animation properties, such as `animation-duration` and `animation-delay`, are set correctly. If they're not, your animations may not work properly.

- **Check for browser compatibility:** Make sure the browser you're targeting supports CSS animations. If it doesn't, your animations won't work.

- **Check for other issues:** If none of the above steps have solved the problem, it's possible that there could be another issue causing the animation to not work. Check the console for any other errors, and make sure all of your code is up to date.

## Example Code

Now that we've gone over the most common causes of animation issues, let's look at some example code. Here's an example of a simple animation that should work in Safari and iOS:

```css
.my-animation {
  animation-name: my-animation;
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-delay: 0.5s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
  animation-iteration-count: 1;
}

@keyframes my-animation {
  from {
    transform: translateY(0px);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(-50px);
  }
}
```

This code should work in Safari and iOS, as long as the correct vendor prefixes are included. If you're having trouble getting your animation to work, try checking your code against this example and make sure all of the properties are set correctly.

## Conclusion

Animation issues in Safari and iOS can be a real headache, but with the right troubleshooting steps, you can get your animations working in no time. Make sure your code is written correctly and that you're using the correct vendor prefixes, and check your animation properties to make sure they're set correctly. With these steps, you should be able to get your animations working properly in Safari and iOS.
