Visual Studio Code is a great tool for writing code in JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a wide range of features, including syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging. However, sometimes the syntax highlighting may not work correctly and can be a source of frustration. This article will discuss some common mistakes and how to troubleshoot them.

## Common Mistakes

One of the most common mistakes is forgetting to enable syntax highlighting for the language being used. Visual Studio Code has syntax highlighting for a variety of languages, but it needs to be enabled before it will be applied. To do this, click on the language in the lower right corner of the editor and select the language you are using.

Another mistake is not selecting the right language for the file. Visual Studio Code will attempt to detect the language based on the file extension, but sometimes this can be wrong. To check the language for a file, click on the language in the lower right corner of the editor and make sure it is set to the correct language.

## Troubleshooting

If syntax highlighting is still not working correctly, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue. The first thing to do is to make sure that the language is set correctly. If the language is set correctly, but syntax highlighting is still not working, try restarting Visual Studio Code.

If restarting does not work, the next step is to check the settings for the language. Visual Studio Code has a number of settings for each language, and they can be accessed by clicking on the gear icon in the lower right corner of the editor. The settings for each language can be found in the “Languages” tab.

The settings for each language can be customized to suit your needs. For example, you can change the color of the syntax highlighting, or change the way that symbols are displayed. If the settings are not configured correctly, the syntax highlighting may not work properly.

## Code Examples

It can be helpful to look at some code examples to get a better understanding of how syntax highlighting works. The following examples demonstrate how syntax highlighting works in JavaScript and TypeScript.

### JavaScript

In the following example, the keyword `var` is highlighted in blue, while the string `Hello World` is highlighted in green.

```javascript
var message = "Hello World";
console.log(message);
```

### TypeScript

In the following example, the keyword `class` is highlighted in blue, while the string `Hello World` is highlighted in green.

```typescript
class Greeter {
  greeting: string;

  constructor(message: string) {
    this.greeting = message;
  }

  greet() {
    return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
  }
}

let greeter = new Greeter("world");
console.log(greeter.greet());
```

## Conclusion

Syntax highlighting is an important feature of Visual Studio Code, and it is important to make sure it is working correctly. If syntax highlighting is not working correctly, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue. First, make sure that the language is set correctly. If the language is set correctly, but syntax highlighting is still not working, try restarting Visual Studio Code. Finally, check the settings for the language to make sure they are configured correctly.

Are you having trouble getting syntax highlighting to work in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for JavaScript and TypeScript? If so, you're not alone. Many developers have experienced similar issues and have found the solution to be quite elusive.

Fortunately, we can help you troubleshoot the syntax highlighting issue in VSCode. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the steps to get your syntax highlighting working correctly.

## Step 1: Check Your Settings

The first step is to check your settings in VSCode. In the lower left corner of the window, click on the gear icon to open the **Settings** tab.

In the **Settings** tab, make sure that the **Language** setting is set to either **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**. If it is set to something else, change it to either of these two options.

## Step 2: Check Your Extensions

The next step is to check your extensions. In the lower left corner of the window, click on the **Extensions** icon.

In the **Extensions** tab, make sure that you have the **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** extensions installed. If you don't have them installed, click the **Install** button next to each one.

## Step 3: Check Your Syntax Highlighting

The next step is to check your syntax highlighting. In the lower left corner of the window, click on the **Syntax Highlighting** icon.

In the **Syntax Highlighting** tab, make sure that you have the **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** syntax highlighting enabled. If you don't have it enabled, click the **Enable** button next to each one.

## Step 4: Check Your Code

The final step is to check your code. Make sure that your code is properly formatted and that all of your brackets, parentheses, and other syntax elements are properly matched.

If you're using TypeScript, make sure that you have the correct type annotations for each variable and function.

## Conclusion
