CSS extraction is the process of extracting CSS from a webpage or application. This process can be used to improve the performance of a website or application by reducing the size of the page and improving the loading speed. Vite is a JavaScript-based tool that can be used to extract CSS from a webpage or application. In this article, we will discuss how to extract CSS with Vite.

## What is Vite?

Vite is a JavaScript-based tool that can be used to extract CSS from a webpage or application. It is a modern web development toolchain that provides a powerful and efficient workflow for building modern applications. Vite is built on top of the popular webpack bundler and allows developers to create and bundle JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code.

## How to Extract CSS with Vite

To extract CSS with Vite, you will need to install the Vite CLI. The Vite CLI is a command-line interface that allows developers to create and bundle JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code.

Once the Vite CLI is installed, you can use the `vite extract` command to extract CSS from a webpage or application. This command will create a new `.css` file that contains the extracted CSS.

For example, if you have a webpage with the following HTML:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

You can use the `vite extract` command to extract the CSS from the page:

```
vite extract --in index.html --out styles.css
```

This command will create a `styles.css` file that contains the extracted CSS from the page.

## Common Mistakes

When extracting CSS with Vite, there are a few common mistakes that developers make. The most common mistakes include:

- Not specifying the `--in` or `--out` options when running the `vite extract` command.

- Not specifying the correct file path for the `--out` option.

It is important to make sure that you specify the correct options and file paths when running the `vite extract` command to ensure that the extracted CSS is written to the correct file.
