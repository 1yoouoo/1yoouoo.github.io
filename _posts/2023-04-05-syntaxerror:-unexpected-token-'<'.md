Syntax errors are one of the most common types of errors that occur in programming. They occur when the programmer has written code that does not comply with the rules of the programming language. In particular, SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' is an error that is thrown when the programming language encounters an unexpected character (in this case, the '<' symbol).

It is important to understand why this error occurs, and what steps can be taken to fix it. This article will explain SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' and provide examples of how to resolve it.

## What Causes SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<'?

SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' occurs when the programming language encounters an unexpected character. This can happen for a variety of reasons. The most common cause is a typo, where the programmer has accidentally typed a character that is not allowed in the programming language. For example, in JavaScript, the '<' symbol is not allowed, and if the programmer accidentally types it, the SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' will be thrown.

Another cause of SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' is when the programmer is attempting to use a feature of the language that is not supported. For example, JavaScript does not support the use of the '<' symbol in a variable name, and if the programmer attempts to do so, the SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' will be thrown.

## Examples of SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<'

To better understand SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<', let's look at some examples.

### Example 1

In this example, the programmer has attempted to create a variable called '<name>'. As mentioned above, JavaScript does not support the use of the '<' symbol in variable names, and so the SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' is thrown:

```javascript
let <name> = 'John';
// SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
```

To fix this issue, the programmer needs to remove the '<' symbol from the variable name.

### Example 2

In this example, the programmer has accidentally typed the '<' symbol instead of the '>' symbol. This is a common typo that can lead to the SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' being thrown:

```javascript
let age = 18;
if (age < 18) {
  console.log('You are too young!');
}
// SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
```

To fix this issue, the programmer needs to replace the '<' symbol with the '>' symbol.

## Conclusion

SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' is a common error that occurs when the programming language encounters an unexpected character. It can be caused by a typo, or by attempting to use a feature of the language that is not supported. By understanding what causes this error, and looking at examples of how to fix it, programmers can quickly resolve this issue and get back to coding.

The dreaded **SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<'** is one of the most common errors that can occur when writing JavaScript or TypeScript code. It usually occurs when the code is missing a closing bracket, parenthesis, or semicolon. It can also occur when there is an extra character in the code, such as an extra space or a typo.

This error can be very difficult to debug, as it can be caused by a number of different issues. It can be especially difficult to debug if the code contains a lot of nested functions or if it is written in a functional programming style.

## What Causes SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<'?

The most common cause of this error is a missing closing bracket, parenthesis, or semicolon. This can happen when the code is written in a functional programming style, as the code may not be written in the same order as it is executed. 

For example, if the code is written as:

```javascript
function foo() {
  return bar
}
```

It will throw a SyntaxError because the `return` statement is missing a semicolon.

Another common cause of this error is an extra character in the code, such as a space or a typo. This can be caused by copy-pasting code from another source, or by simply typing too quickly.

## How to Debug SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<'

The first step in debugging this error is to check for any missing brackets, parenthesis, or semicolons. This can be done by manually checking the code, or by using a linter, such as ESLint.

If the code contains a lot of nested functions, it can be helpful to break it down into smaller chunks to make it easier to debug. This can be done by using the `console.log()` statement to output the values of variables and functions.

If the code contains an extra character, such as a space or a typo, then the best way to debug it is to use a diff tool, such as Git Diff. This will show any differences between the code and the source, allowing you to easily identify any extra characters.

## Conclusion

The SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' is one of the most common errors that can occur when writing JavaScript or TypeScript code. It is usually caused by a missing closing bracket, parenthesis, or semicolon, or by an extra character in the code.

Debugging this error can be difficult, but it can be made easier by using a linter, breaking the code down into smaller chunks, and using a diff tool. With the right tools and techniques, it is possible to quickly identify and fix this error.
