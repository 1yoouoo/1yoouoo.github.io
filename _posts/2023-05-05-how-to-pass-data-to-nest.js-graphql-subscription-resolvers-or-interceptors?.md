Passing data to Nest.js GraphQL subscription resolvers or interceptors can be a tricky task. This is because the data needs to be formatted correctly in order to be used in the resolvers or interceptors. Fortunately, there are a few techniques that can be used to make this process easier. In this article, we will discuss how to pass data to Nest.js GraphQL subscription resolvers or interceptors and some common mistakes to avoid.

## Passing Data to Subscription Resolvers

When passing data to a subscription resolver, it is important to format the data correctly. The data must be in the form of an object, with the keys representing the variables used in the subscription query. For example, if the subscription query contains the variables `name` and `age`, the data must be in the form of an object with the keys `name` and `age`.

```javascript
const data = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};
```

Once the data is in the correct format, it can be passed to the subscription resolver as an argument. The data can then be used in the resolver to return the appropriate data.

```javascript
const resolver = (obj, args, context, info) => {
  const { name, age } = args;
  return {
    name,
    age
  };
};
```

## Passing Data to Interceptors

When passing data to an interceptor, the data must be in the form of an object with the keys representing the variables used in the subscription query. The data can then be passed to the interceptor as an argument. The interceptor can then use the data to modify the subscription query before it is executed.

```javascript
const interceptor = (obj, args, context, info) => {
  const { name, age } = args;
  const modifiedQuery = {
    name,
    age,
    isActive: true
  };
  return modifiedQuery;
};
```

## Common Mistakes

When passing data to Nest.js GraphQL subscription resolvers or interceptors, there are a few common mistakes to avoid. First, it is important to ensure that the data is in the correct format before passing it to the resolver or interceptor. If the data is not in the correct format, the resolver or interceptor will not be able to use the data.

Second, it is important to ensure that the data contains all of the variables that are used in the subscription query. If the data does not contain all of the variables, the resolver or interceptor will not be able to use the data.

Finally, it is important to ensure that the data is in the correct format before passing it to the resolver or interceptor. If the data is not in the correct format, the resolver or interceptor will not be able to use the data.

GraphQL is a powerful query language that allows developers to create complex, data-driven applications. However, one of the challenges of using GraphQL is that it can be difficult to pass data to resolvers and interceptors. This can be especially tricky when using Nest.js, a popular Node.js framework for creating GraphQL applications.

In this article, we'll discuss how to pass data to Nest.js GraphQL subscription resolvers and interceptors. We'll also look at some examples to help you understand the concepts better. Let's get started!

## What is a GraphQL Subscription Resolver?

A GraphQL subscription resolver is a function that is used to resolve a subscription query. It is responsible for returning the data that the client has requested. A subscription resolver is different from a query resolver in that it is used to listen for changes in the data and then send the updated data to the client.

## What is a GraphQL Interceptor?

A GraphQL interceptor is a function that is used to modify the data that is being sent to the client. It can be used to add additional information to the data or to modify the data before it is sent to the client.

## How to Pass Data to Nest.js GraphQL Subscription Resolvers

When using Nest.js to create GraphQL applications, you can pass data to subscription resolvers using the `@Subscription` decorator. The `@Subscription` decorator takes two parameters: the subscription name and an optional object containing data to be passed to the resolver.

For example, if we wanted to pass a user's ID to a subscription resolver, we could do so like this:

```typescript
@Subscription('userUpdated', {
  data: {
    id: 'user-id'
  }
})
```

The data object in the `@Subscription` decorator can contain any type of data, including objects, strings, numbers, and booleans.

## How to Pass Data to Nest.js GraphQL Interceptors

Nest.js also provides a way to pass data to GraphQL interceptors. To do this, you can use the `@Interceptor` decorator. The `@Interceptor` decorator takes two parameters: the interceptor name and an optional object containing data to be passed to the interceptor.

For example, if we wanted to pass a user's ID to an interceptor, we could do so like this:

```typescript
@Interceptor('userUpdated', {
  data: {
    id: 'user-id'
  }
})
```

The data object in the `@Interceptor` decorator can contain any type of data, including objects, strings, numbers, and booleans.

## Conclusion

In this article, we discussed how to pass data to Nest.js GraphQL subscription resolvers and interceptors. We looked at how to pass data using the `@Subscription` and `@Interceptor` decorators. We also looked at some examples to help you understand the concepts better.

If you're looking to create a GraphQL application with Nest.js, it's important to understand how to pass data to subscription resolvers and interceptors. With the information in this article, you should have a better understanding of how to do this.
