When developing React applications, it is common to encounter errors related to unexpected tokens. This is especially true when using a continuous integration (CI) system such as Azure Pipelines to build and deploy your application. In this tutorial, we will discuss the most common causes of unexpected token errors and how to troubleshoot them.

## What is an Unexpected Token Error?

An unexpected token error is a common syntax error that occurs when the Javascript or Typescript parser encounters an unexpected character in the code. This can be caused by a missing comma, a missing bracket, or a missing semicolon. This error can be difficult to identify since it is often caused by a typo or incorrect syntax.

## Common Causes of Unexpected Token Errors

When troubleshooting unexpected token errors, it is important to identify the root cause of the error. The most common causes of unexpected token errors are:

1. **Missing Commas**: A missing comma can cause an unexpected token error if it is not included between two elements of an array or object. For example, the following code will cause an unexpected token error because the comma is missing between the two elements:

```javascript
const myArray = [1 2];
```

2. **Missing Brackets**: A missing bracket can cause an unexpected token error if it is not included at the beginning or end of an array or object. For example, the following code will cause an unexpected token error because the closing bracket is missing:

```javascript
const myArray = [1, 2;
```

3. **Missing Semicolons**: A missing semicolon can cause an unexpected token error if it is not included at the end of a statement. For example, the following code will cause an unexpected token error because the semicolon is missing:

```javascript
const myVariable = 5
```

4. **Incorrect Syntax**: Incorrect syntax can cause an unexpected token error if the syntax does not match the language being used. For example, the following code will cause an unexpected token error because the syntax does not match the Javascript language:

```javascript
let myVariable = 5
```

## Troubleshooting Unexpected Token Errors

When troubleshooting unexpected token errors, it is important to identify the root cause of the error and then take the appropriate steps to fix it. The most common steps for troubleshooting unexpected token errors are:

1. **Check for Missing Commas**: When troubleshooting unexpected token errors, the first step should be to check for missing commas. If a comma is missing between two elements of an array or object, the code will cause an unexpected token error.

2. **Check for Missing Brackets**: The next step should be to check for missing brackets. If a bracket is missing at the beginning or end of an array or object, the code will cause an unexpected token error.

3. **Check for Missing Semicolons**: The next step should be to check for missing semicolons. If a semicolon is missing at the end of a statement, the code will cause an unexpected token error.

4. **Check for Incorrect Syntax**: The final step should be to check for incorrect syntax. If the syntax does not match the language being used, the code will cause an unexpected token error.

## Conclusion

Unexpected token errors can be difficult to identify and troubleshoot. However, by following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you should be able to identify the root cause of the error and take the appropriate steps to fix it.
If you're seeing an unexpected token error when running an NPM build on an Azure Pipeline for React, you're not alone! This is a common issue that can be difficult to diagnose and fix. In this blog post, we'll take a look at the cause of this error and provide a step-by-step guide to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

## What is an Unexpected Token Error?
An unexpected token error is a syntax error that occurs when the JavaScript parser encounters a token that it doesn't recognize. This typically occurs when the parser encounters a token that it expects to be followed by another token, but instead finds something else. For example, if the parser expects to find a closing parenthesis but instead finds a comma, it will throw an unexpected token error.

## What Causes an Unexpected Token Error?
There are a few common causes of unexpected token errors. The most common is a typo in the code. This can be as simple as a missing semicolon or a misspelled keyword. Another common cause is an incorrect syntax. This can happen when the code is written in a way that the parser doesn't understand. For example, if a function call is missing its closing parenthesis, the parser will throw an unexpected token error.

## Troubleshooting an Unexpected Token Error in Azure Pipeline NPM Build for React
If you're seeing an unexpected token error in an Azure Pipeline NPM build for React, the first step is to identify the source of the error. This can be done by examining the build log and looking for the line that contains the error.

Once you've identified the source of the error, you can begin troubleshooting. The most common cause of unexpected token errors in Azure Pipeline NPM builds is a typo in the code. To fix this, you'll need to find the line of code that contains the error and correct the typo.

If the typo isn't the cause of the error, the next step is to check the syntax of the code. This can be done by examining the code and making sure that it follows the correct syntax. For example, if the code is missing a closing parenthesis, you'll need to add one.

If the syntax is correct, the next step is to check for any missing or incorrect dependencies. This can be done by examining the package.json file and making sure that all the dependencies are present and correct.

If all else fails, the final step is to check for any issues with the build environment. This can be done by examining the build log and looking for any errors related to the build environment.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we took a look at the cause of unexpected token errors in Azure Pipeline NPM builds for React and provided a step-by-step guide to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue. We hope this guide has been helpful and that you're now able to successfully build your React application on Azure Pipeline.
