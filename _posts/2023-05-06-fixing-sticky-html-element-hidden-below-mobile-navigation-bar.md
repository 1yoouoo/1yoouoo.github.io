When designing a website, it is often necessary to make certain elements of the page “sticky”, meaning that they remain visible even when the user scrolls down the page. This is especially important for mobile navigation bars, which are often hidden below the main content of the page. Unfortunately, this can cause some problems when the sticky element is an HTML element, as the element may become hidden below the mobile navigation bar. In this article, we will discuss some of the common causes of this issue and how to fix it.

## Causes of the Issue

The most common cause of the sticky HTML element being hidden below the mobile navigation bar is due to incorrect positioning. When the sticky element is positioned incorrectly, it may become hidden below the mobile navigation bar. Additionally, if the sticky element is too large or too small, it may also become hidden.

Another possible cause of the issue is due to incorrect styling. If the element is not styled correctly, it may become hidden below the mobile navigation bar. For example, if the element has a background color or is set to a certain width, it may become hidden.

## Fixing the Issue

The first step in fixing the issue is to ensure that the sticky element is positioned correctly. To do this, you can use the `position: sticky` CSS property. This property allows you to specify the position of the element relative to the viewport, which is the area of the page that is visible to the user.

Once the element is positioned correctly, you can then adjust the styling of the element to ensure that it is visible. This can be done by setting the background color, width, and other styling properties.

Finally, you can use JavaScript or TypeScript to ensure that the element is visible even when the user scrolls the page. To do this, you can use the `window.addEventListener()` method to listen for the `scroll` event. When the event is triggered, you can use the `window.scrollY` property to determine the current scroll position of the page.

Once you have determined the scroll position, you can then adjust the position of the sticky element accordingly. For example, if the user scrolls down the page, you can adjust the position of the element to ensure that it is always visible.

## Conclusion

Fixing sticky HTML elements hidden below mobile navigation bars can be a challenging task. However, by following the steps outlined in this article, it is possible to ensure that the element is always visible. By ensuring that the element is correctly positioned, styled correctly, and adjusted with JavaScript or TypeScript, you can ensure that the element is always visible to the user.
If you’re a web developer, you’ve probably encountered the dreaded sticky HTML element hidden below mobile navigation bar. It’s a common problem that can be difficult to debug and fix. In this post, we’ll go over the causes of this issue and how to fix it.

## What Causes the Sticky HTML Element Hidden Below Mobile Navigation Bar?
The most common cause of the sticky HTML element hidden below mobile navigation bar is a combination of CSS and HTML. When a website is designed with a mobile-first approach, the navigation bar is usually placed at the top of the page. This means that any elements below the navigation bar will be “pushed down” and may end up being hidden behind the navigation bar.

## How to Fix the Sticky HTML Element Hidden Below Mobile Navigation Bar?
The solution to this issue is to use CSS to make sure that the element is always visible. This can be done in a few different ways, depending on the type of element you are working with.

### 1. Use the `position: relative` Property
The first way to fix the sticky HTML element hidden below mobile navigation bar is to use the `position: relative` property. This property will allow the element to be positioned relative to its parent element. This means that it will always be visible, regardless of the size of the navigation bar.

To use the `position: relative` property, simply add the following code to your CSS:

```css
.element {
  position: relative;
}
```

### 2. Use the `z-index` Property
Another way to fix the sticky HTML element hidden below mobile navigation bar is to use the `z-index` property. This property allows you to set the stacking order of elements on a page. By setting the `z-index` of the element to a higher value than the navigation bar, you can ensure that it is always visible.

To use the `z-index` property, simply add the following code to your CSS:

```css
.element {
  z-index: 1;
}
```

### 3. Use the `overflow` Property
The final way to fix the sticky HTML element hidden below mobile navigation bar is to use the `overflow` property. This property allows you to specify how the element should behave when it is larger than its parent element. By setting the `overflow` property to `visible`, you can ensure that the element is always visible, regardless of the size of the navigation bar.

To use the `overflow` property, simply add the following code to your CSS:

```css
.element {
  overflow: visible;
}
```

## Conclusion
The sticky HTML element hidden below mobile navigation bar can be a tricky issue to debug and fix. However, with the right knowledge and techniques, it can be easily solved. By using the `position: relative`, `z-index`, and `overflow` properties, you can make sure that your element is always visible, regardless of the size of the navigation bar.
