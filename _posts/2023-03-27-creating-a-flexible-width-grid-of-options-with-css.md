## Common Mistakes
When attempting to create a flexible width grid of options with CSS, one of the most common mistakes people make is not accounting for the different screen sizes.

To avoid this, it's important to use responsive design techniques, such as using media queries to adjust the grid width based on the device's screen size.

Different browsers may render the same code differently, so it's important to test the grid on multiple browsers and devices to ensure it looks correct on all of them.

## Tips for Creating a Flexible Width Grid of Options with CSS
One of the best ways to create a flexible width grid of options with CSS is to use a framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation. These frameworks provide pre-made grids that can easily be customized to fit any design.

Another tip for creating a flexible width grid of options with CSS is to use relative units such as percentages or ems instead of absolute units such as pixels. This will ensure that the grid will scale correctly on different screen sizes.

It's also important to use media queries to adjust the grid width based on the device's screen size. This will ensure that the grid looks correct on all devices.

Finally, it's important to use a mobile-first approach when creating a flexible width grid of options with CSS. This will ensure that the grid looks correct on all devices, from desktop to mobile.
