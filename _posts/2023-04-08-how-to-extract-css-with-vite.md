Vite is a modern, lightweight and performant tool for building web applications. It is a build tool that allows developers to write modern JavaScript and TypeScript code and compile it into highly optimized production-ready bundles. Vite also provides a plugin system that allows developers to extend the capabilities of the build tool in a variety of ways. One of these plugins is the Vite Extract CSS plugin, which allows developers to extract the CSS code from their JavaScript or TypeScript code and store it in a separate file. 

In this article, we will discuss how to use the Vite Extract CSS plugin to extract the CSS code from your JavaScript or TypeScript code and store it in a separate file. We will also discuss some common mistakes that developers make when using the plugin and how to avoid them. 

## Installing the Plugin
The first step in using the Vite Extract CSS plugin is to install it in your project. To do this, you will need to install the plugin from npm. You can do this by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```
npm install @vitejs/plugin-extract-css
```

Once the plugin has been installed, you will need to add it to your Vite config file. To do this, open the `vite.config.js` file in your project's root directory and add the following code:

```js
import ExtractCss from '@vitejs/plugin-extract-css'

export default {
  plugins: [
    ExtractCss({
      filename: 'styles.css'
    })
  ]
}
```

The `filename` option specifies the name of the file where the extracted CSS code will be stored. You can change this to whatever you like.

## Extracting the CSS
Once the plugin has been installed, you can start extracting the CSS code from your JavaScript or TypeScript code. To do this, you will need to wrap your CSS code in a `<style>` tag and then import it into your JavaScript or TypeScript code. For example, if you have a `styles.css` file in your project's root directory, you can import it into your JavaScript or TypeScript code like this:

```js
import './styles.css'
```

Once you have imported the CSS file into your JavaScript or TypeScript code, the Vite Extract CSS plugin will automatically extract the CSS code and store it in the file specified in your Vite config file.

## Common Mistakes
When using the Vite Extract CSS plugin, there are a few common mistakes that developers make. One of the most common mistakes is forgetting to import the CSS file into the JavaScript or TypeScript code. If you forget to do this, the plugin will not be able to extract the CSS code from your code and store it in a separate file. 

Another common mistake is not specifying a filename for the extracted CSS code. If you do not specify a filename, the plugin will not know where to store the extracted CSS code and it will not be saved. 

Finally, some developers make the mistake of not wrapping their CSS code in a `<style>` tag. If you do not wrap your CSS code in a `<style>` tag, the plugin will not be able to extract the code and store it in a separate file. 

## Conclusion
In this article, we discussed how to use the Vite Extract CSS plugin to extract the CSS code from your JavaScript or TypeScript code and store it in a separate file. We also discussed some common mistakes that developers make when using the plugin and how to avoid them. By following the steps outlined in this article, you should be able to successfully extract the CSS code from your code and store it in a separate file.

CSS extraction is a process that allows developers to extract CSS from JavaScript or TypeScript files. This process can be used to improve the performance of a website or application. It can also be used to reduce the size of the JavaScript and TypeScript files, or to simplify the code.

In this post, we will look at how to use Vite to extract CSS from JavaScript or TypeScript files. Vite is an open-source build tool and development server for modern web applications. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use.

## Why Extract CSS?

Extracting CSS from JavaScript or TypeScript files can be beneficial in a number of ways. It can improve the performance of your website or application by reducing the size of the JavaScript and TypeScript files. It can also simplify the code by removing any unnecessary code.

Extracting CSS with Vite can also help to improve the performance of your website or application by reducing the size of the CSS files. This is done by extracting the CSS from the JavaScript or TypeScript files and placing it in a separate file. This reduces the size of the JavaScript and TypeScript files, as well as the size of the CSS files.

## How to Extract CSS with Vite

To extract CSS with Vite, you need to first install the Vite CLI. This can be done using the following command:

```
$ npm install -g @vite/cli
```

Once the Vite CLI is installed, you can use the `vite extract` command to extract the CSS from your JavaScript or TypeScript files. The command takes two arguments: the path to the JavaScript or TypeScript file and the path to the output CSS file.

For example, if you have a JavaScript file located at `src/index.js` and you want to extract the CSS to a file located at `dist/index.css`, you can use the following command:

```
$ vite extract src/index.js dist/index.css
```

The command will extract the CSS from the JavaScript or TypeScript file and place it in the output CSS file.

## Conclusion

In this post, we looked at how to use Vite to extract CSS from JavaScript or TypeScript files. We saw how extracting CSS can improve the performance of a website or application, as well as reduce the size of the JavaScript and TypeScript files. We also saw how to use the `vite extract` command to extract the CSS from a JavaScript or TypeScript file and place it in an output CSS file.
