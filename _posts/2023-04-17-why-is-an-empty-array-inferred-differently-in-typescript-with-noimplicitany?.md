When working with TypeScript, you may come across an error that states: "NoImplicitAny: Implicit any type for '[empty]'." This error can be confusing at first, as it is not immediately clear what is causing it. In this article, we'll explore what this error means and how to fix it.

In TypeScript, the `noImplicitAny` compiler option is used to enable stricter type checking. This option prevents the compiler from automatically inferring the type of a variable or expression. This can be helpful when you want to ensure that your code is type-safe and that all types are explicitly declared.

However, when `noImplicitAny` is enabled, the compiler will raise an error if it cannot infer the type of an expression. This is the case when working with empty arrays. By default, TypeScript will infer the type of an empty array as `any`, which is why the compiler will raise an error if `noImplicitAny` is enabled.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

```typescript
// Compiler option
"noImplicitAny": true

// Code
const arr = [];
```

In this example, the compiler will raise an error because it cannot infer the type of the `arr` variable. To fix this, you must explicitly declare the type of the array. For example:

```typescript
// Compiler option
"noImplicitAny": true

// Code
const arr: number[] = [];
```

In this example, we have explicitly declared the type of the `arr` variable as `number[]`, which means that it is an array of numbers. By doing this, we have satisfied the compiler and it will no longer raise an error.

It is important to note that this error will only be raised if the `noImplicitAny` compiler option is enabled. If it is not enabled, then the compiler will automatically infer the type of the `arr` variable as `any` and no error will be raised.

It is also important to note that this error can occur when working with other types of expressions. For example, if you are working with a function that does not have a return type specified, then the compiler will raise an error if `noImplicitAny` is enabled. To fix this, you must explicitly declare the return type of the function.

In conclusion, when working with TypeScript and the `noImplicitAny` compiler option is enabled, the compiler will raise an error if it cannot infer the type of an expression. This is the case when working with empty arrays, as the compiler will infer the type as `any` by default. To fix this, you must explicitly declare the type of the expression.

TypeScript is a powerful typed language that provides developers with the tools to write robust code. One of the great features of TypeScript is its ability to infer the types of variables and expressions based on the context in which they are used. This feature can be very useful in preventing errors, but it can also cause unexpected behavior if not used correctly. In particular, this article will discuss why an empty array is inferred differently in TypeScript when noImplicitAny is set to true.

## Understanding TypeScript Inference

Before we can understand why an empty array is inferred differently in TypeScript with noImplicitAny, we must first understand how TypeScript infers types. In TypeScript, the type of a variable or expression is determined by the context in which it is used. For example, if a variable is assigned a value of type `string`, then its type will be inferred as `string`. Similarly, if an expression is used in a context where its type is known, then the type of the expression will be inferred from the context.

For example, if a variable is assigned the value of a function that returns a `string`, then the type of the variable will be inferred as `string`. Similarly, if an expression is used in a context where its type is known, then the type of the expression will be inferred from the context.

## Understanding noImplicitAny

TypeScript also has a feature called `noImplicitAny`, which is used to prevent TypeScript from inferring the type of a variable or expression as `any`. `any` is the most general type in TypeScript and should be avoided when possible. When `noImplicitAny` is set to `true`, TypeScript will not infer the type of a variable or expression as `any` unless it is explicitly specified.

## Understanding the Empty Array Inference

When `noImplicitAny` is set to `true`, TypeScript will infer the type of an empty array as `any[]`. This means that an empty array will be inferred as an array of `any` type. This behavior is different from the behavior when `noImplicitAny` is set to `false`, where an empty array will be inferred as an array of `unknown` type.

The reason for this behavior is that TypeScript is unable to infer the type of an empty array when `noImplicitAny` is set to `true`. Since TypeScript is unable to infer the type of an empty array, it will default to the most general type, which is `any`.

## Example

To better understand why an empty array is inferred differently in TypeScript when `noImplicitAny` is set to `true`, let's look at an example.

```typescript
let arr: any[];

arr = []; // Type is inferred as any[]
```

In the above example, we have declared a variable `arr` with the type `any[]`. We then assign an empty array to the `arr` variable. Because `noImplicitAny` is set to `true`, TypeScript will infer the type of the empty array as `any[]`.

## Conclusion

In this article, we discussed why an empty array is inferred differently in TypeScript when `noImplicitAny` is set to `true`. We saw that when `noImplicitAny` is set to `true`, TypeScript will infer the type of an empty array as `any[]`, while when `noImplicitAny` is set to `false`, the type of an empty array will be inferred as `unknown`. We also saw an example of how this behavior works in practice.

By understanding why an empty array is inferred differently in TypeScript with `noImplicitAny`, developers can avoid unexpected behavior and ensure that their code is written correctly.
