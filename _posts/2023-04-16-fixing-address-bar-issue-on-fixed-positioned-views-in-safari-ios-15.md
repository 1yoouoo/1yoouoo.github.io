The **Address Bar** issue on **Fixed Positioned Views** in Safari iOS 15 is a common problem that developers often face when creating mobile applications. This issue occurs when developers set the `position` of a view to `fixed` and the address bar overlaps the view. This can be an annoying problem for developers as it makes it difficult for users to access the content of the view.

In order to fix this issue, developers must use a combination of **CSS** and **JavaScript**. The following code snippet demonstrates the solution.

## CSS

The first step is to set the `position` of the view to `fixed`. This will ensure that the view is always visible, regardless of the position of the address bar.

```css
.view {
    position: fixed;
}
```

The next step is to set the `top` and `bottom` properties of the view. This will ensure that the view is always positioned correctly, regardless of the size of the address bar.

```css
.view {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
}
```

## JavaScript

Once the view is positioned correctly, the next step is to use JavaScript to adjust the view when the address bar is visible. This can be done using the `window.addEventListener` method.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
    // Adjust the view when the address bar is visible
});
```

The code above will be executed when the window is resized, which will happen when the address bar is visible. Inside the `resize` event handler, we can use the `window.innerHeight` property to check if the address bar is visible.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
    if (window.innerHeight < window.innerWidth) {
        // Adjust the view when the address bar is visible
    }
});
```

If the `window.innerHeight` is less than the `window.innerWidth`, then we know that the address bar is visible. We can then use the `window.scrollTo` method to scroll the view so that it is not overlapped by the address bar.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
    if (window.innerHeight < window.innerWidth) {
        window.scrollTo(0, window.innerHeight);
    }
});
```

The code above will scroll the view to the top of the window, which will ensure that the view is not overlapped by the address bar.

## Conclusion

Fixing the Address Bar issue on Fixed Positioned Views in Safari iOS 15 is a common problem that developers face. The solution is to use a combination of CSS and JavaScript to adjust the view when the address bar is visible. By setting the `position` of the view to `fixed` and using the `window.addEventListener` and `window.scrollTo` methods, developers can ensure that the view is always visible and not overlapped by the address bar.

When developing an application for iOS, you may come across an issue where the address bar appears when scrolling a view that has a fixed position. This issue can be especially frustrating because the address bar will appear and obscure the content of the view, making it difficult to interact with.

Fortunately, this issue can be resolved with a few simple steps. In this blog post, we'll discuss how to fix the address bar issue on fixed positioned views in Safari iOS 15.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, there are a few prerequisites you'll need to have in place. First, you'll need to be running Safari iOS 15 or later. Next, you'll need to be developing with a web framework such as React, Vue, or Angular. Finally, you'll need to be familiar with HTML and CSS.

## The Problem

The issue occurs when a fixed positioned view is scrolled in Safari iOS 15. When the view is scrolled, the address bar will appear and obscure the content of the view. This makes it difficult to interact with the content of the view.

## The Solution

The solution to this issue is to add a `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` property to the element that has the fixed position. This property will ensure that the address bar does not appear when the view is scrolled.

To add this property, you'll need to add the following code to the element that has the fixed position:

```css
-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
```

Once this property is added, the address bar will no longer appear when the view is scrolled.
