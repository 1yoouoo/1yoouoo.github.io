A SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' error is a common problem in JavaScript and is caused by an unexpected character appearing in the code. This error can occur when a user is trying to execute a JavaScript program, and the code contains an unexpected character. This unexpected character can be a single quote (') or a less-than sign (<). In most cases, this error occurs when the user is trying to execute a JavaScript program that contains an invalid character.

When a user encounters this error, the JavaScript interpreter will stop executing the program and display an error message. The error message will usually contain the line number of the code where the unexpected character was encountered. This can help the user to identify the source of the error and correct it.

The SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' error can be caused by a variety of factors. One of the most common causes is when the user is trying to execute a program that contains an invalid character. This invalid character can be a single quote (') or a less-than sign (<). In some cases, the error can also be caused by a missing semicolon (;) or a missing closing parenthesis (}).

Another common cause of this error is when the user is trying to execute a program that contains an incorrect syntax. For example, if the user is trying to execute a JavaScript program that contains an incorrect syntax, the interpreter will stop executing the program and display an error message.

In addition, this error can also occur when the user is trying to execute a program that contains an invalid character. For example, if the user is trying to execute a JavaScript program that contains a single quote (') or a less-than sign (<) within a string, the interpreter will stop executing the program and display an error message.

Finally, this error can also occur when the user is trying to execute a program that contains an incorrect syntax. For example, if the user is trying to execute a JavaScript program that contains an incorrect syntax, the interpreter will stop executing the program and display an error message.

To illustrate, let's take a look at the following example of a JavaScript program that contains an unexpected character:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = < 10;
```

In this example, the user is trying to assign the value of 5 to the variable `x` and the value of 10 to the variable `y`. However, the user has used a less-than sign (<) instead of an equals sign (=). As a result, the interpreter will stop executing the program and display an error message. The error message will look something like this:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<'
```

In this case, the user can easily identify the source of the error and correct it by replacing the less-than sign (<) with an equals sign (=).

In conclusion, a SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<' error is a common problem in JavaScript and is caused by an unexpected character appearing in the code. This error can occur when a user is trying to execute a JavaScript program, and the code contains an unexpected character. This unexpected character can be a single quote (') or a less-than sign (<). In most cases, this error occurs when the user is trying to execute a JavaScript program that contains an invalid character.

When writing code, we often encounter errors like `SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<'`. This error is caused by a mis-typed character, usually a less than sign (<) that is not part of the syntax of the language in which the code was written.

The most common cause of this error is when a user attempts to write code in a language that does not support the less than sign. For example, if you were trying to write code in JavaScript, but instead wrote it in HTML, the less than sign would be an unexpected token.

Another common cause of this error is when a user attempts to write code in a language that does not understand the less than sign as a valid operator. For example, if you were trying to write code in C++ and used the less than sign as an operator, it would be an unexpected token.

Finally, this error can also occur when a user attempts to write code in a language that does not recognize the less than sign as a valid character. For example, if you were trying to write code in Python, but instead used the less than sign as a character, it would be an unexpected token.

## How to Fix the SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<'

The best way to fix this error is to first determine the cause. If the code was written in a language that does not support the less than sign, then the code should be rewritten in the correct language.

If the code was written in a language that does not understand the less than sign as a valid operator, then the code should be rewritten to use a different operator.

Finally, if the code was written in a language that does not recognize the less than sign as a valid character, then the code should be rewritten to use a different character.

## Example of Fixing the SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<'

Let's look at an example of how to fix this error. Suppose we have the following code written in JavaScript:

```javascript
let x = < 10;
```

This code is attempting to use the less than sign as an operator, which is not valid in JavaScript. To fix this, we can rewrite the code to use the less than or equal to operator instead:

```javascript
let x = <= 10;
```

Now the code is valid and should no longer generate the `SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<'` error.

## Conclusion

The `SyntaxError: Unexpected Token '<'` error is caused by a mis-typed character, usually a less than sign (<) that is not part of the syntax of the language in which the code was written. To fix this error, you must first determine the cause, then rewrite the code to use a different character or operator. By following the steps outlined in this post, you should be able to quickly and easily fix this error.
