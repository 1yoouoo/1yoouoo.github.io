When using MongooseModule in Nestjs to connect to a MongoDB database, developers may encounter errors when attempting to use the `.env` file to store credentials. This article will provide an overview of the common errors associated with this issue, as well as a step-by-step guide to resolving them.

## Common Errors

When attempting to use the `.env` file to store credentials for MongooseModule in Nestjs, developers may encounter several common errors. These errors include:

* `MongooseModule.forRoot() requires a configuration object.`
* `MongooseModule.forRoot() requires a valid configuration object.`
* `MongooseModule.forRoot() requires a valid URI string.`

These errors can be caused by a variety of issues, including an incorrectly formatted `.env` file, an invalid URI string, or an incorrectly configured MongooseModule.

## Step-by-Step Guide

In order to resolve these errors, developers must first ensure that their `.env` file is correctly formatted. This can be done by ensuring that the `MONGO_URI` variable is properly set, and that the `MONGO_USERNAME` and `MONGO_PASSWORD` variables are set if the database requires authentication.

Next, developers must ensure that the URI string is valid. This can be done by using a URI validator such as [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/).

Finally, developers must ensure that the MongooseModule is correctly configured. This can be done by using the following code:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MongooseModule } from '@nestjs/mongoose';

@Module({
  imports: [
    MongooseModule.forRoot(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
      useCreateIndex: true,
      useFindAndModify: false,
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The code above will ensure that the MongooseModule is correctly configured and that the `.env` file is correctly read.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, when attempting to use the `.env` file to store credentials for MongooseModule in Nestjs, developers may encounter several common errors. These errors can be caused by an incorrectly formatted `.env` file, an invalid URI string, or an incorrectly configured MongooseModule. In order to resolve these errors, developers must first ensure that their `.env` file is correctly formatted, then ensure that the URI string is valid, and finally ensure that the MongooseModule is correctly configured.

Nestjs is a great framework for building server-side applications. It's modular structure and use of TypeScript makes it a great choice for developers looking to build complex applications quickly and efficiently. However, one of the challenges that developers can face when using Nestjs is the MongooseModule error. This error occurs when the environment variables in the .env file are not correctly configured. In this blog post, we'll discuss how to resolve this error and get your application up and running again.

## What is the MongooseModule Error?

The MongooseModule error occurs when the environment variables in the .env file are not correctly configured. This error is usually caused by incorrect values being set in the .env file or by missing values. When this error occurs, Nestjs will throw an error similar to the following:

```
[Nest] 11800   - 03/26/2020, 11:53:53 AM   [ExceptionsHandler] MongooseModule.forRoot() is not called. +7ms

```

This error is caused by the MongooseModule not being correctly configured in the .env file. The MongooseModule is responsible for connecting to the MongoDB database, so if the configuration is incorrect, the application will be unable to connect to the database.

## How to Resolve the MongooseModule Error

To resolve the MongooseModule error, you need to make sure that the environment variables in the .env file are correctly configured. The environment variables that need to be configured in the .env file are:

* `MONGO_URI`: The MongoDB connection string.
* `MONGO_USER`: The username for the MongoDB database.
* `MONGO_PASS`: The password for the MongoDB database.

Once these environment variables are correctly configured, you can then import them into the Nestjs application using the `config()` function. The `config()` function takes an object as an argument and returns the environment variables from the .env file. You can then use the `MongooseModule.forRoot()` function to connect to the MongoDB database.

```javascript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MongooseModule } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { config } from 'dotenv';

@Module({
  imports: [
    MongooseModule.forRoot(config().parsed.MONGO_URI, {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
      user: config().parsed.MONGO_USER,
      pass: config().parsed.MONGO_PASS
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The `MongooseModule.forRoot()` function takes the MongoDB connection string, the username, and the password as arguments. Once this is done, you can then start the application and the MongooseModule error should be resolved.

## Conclusion

The MongooseModule error is a common issue when working with Nestjs and MongoDB. By correctly configuring the environment variables in the .env file and using the `MongooseModule.forRoot()` function, you can easily resolve this error and get your application up and running again.
